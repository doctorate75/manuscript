  abstract = {The PCR is an extremely powerful method for detecting microorganisms. However, its full potential as a rapid detection method is limited by the inhibition of the thermostable DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus by many components found in complex biological samples. In this study, we have compared the effects of known PCR-inhibiting samples on nine thermostable DNA polymerases. Samples of blood, cheese, feces, and meat, as well as various ions, were added to PCR mixtures containing various thermostable DNA polymerases. The nucleic acid amplification capacity of the nine polymerases, under buffer conditions recommended by the manufacturers, was evaluated by using a PCR-based detection method for Listeria monocytogenes in the presence of purified template DNA and different concentrations of PCR inhibitors. The AmpliTaq Gold and the Taq DNA polymerases from Thermus aquaticus were totally inhibited in the presence of 0.004\% (vol/vol) blood in the PCR mixture, while the HotTub, Pwo, rTth, and Tfl DNA polymerases were able to amplify DNA in the presence of 20\% (vol/vol) blood without reduced amplification sensitivity. The DNA polymerase from Thermotoga maritima (Ultma) was found to be the most susceptible to PCR inhibitors present in cheese, feces, and meat samples. When the inhibitory effect of K and Na ions was tested on the nine polymerases, HotTub from Thermus flavus and rTth from Thermus thermophilus were the most resistant. Thus, the PCR-inhibiting effect of various components in biological samples can, to some extent, be eliminated by the use of the appropriate thermostable DNA polymerase.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori leads to gastritis and in a subpopulation of infected individuals to ulcers and cancer. Bacterial virulence factors and host immune inflammatory responses are risk factors related to disease. CD4+ T cells secrete cytokines that promote inflammation and an anti-bacterial response in the gastric mucosa during infection. The aim of the study was to investigate the pattern of expression of CD4+ T cell derived cytokines, IL-17A and IFN{$\gamma$} in paired antrum and corpus biopsies and correlate it to H. pylori infection outcome. METHODS: Gene and protein expression of IL-17A and IFN{$\gamma$} was analyzed in gastric biopsies from H. pylori infected subjects with non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) or gastric ulcer; and for comparison uninfected individuals. RESULTS: Upregulation of IL-17A and IFN{$\gamma$} gene expression was seen in corpus and antrum biopsies of H. pylori infected individuals with NUD compared to in uninfected controls. The expression of these cytokines correlated significantly with each other. Immunofluorescence staining revealed increased frequencies of IL-17A+ and IFN{$\gamma$}+ cells in antrum biopsies of gastric ulcer patients compared to of H. pylori infected NUD individuals; positive cells were not detected in any of the biopsies of uninfected controls. The frequencies of IFN{$\gamma$} and IL-17A+ cells correlated positively with inflammation in the antrum, but not the corpus, of H. pylori infected individuals. In the antrum, while there was no significant evidence of correlation between IFN{$\gamma$} and bacterial score, a positive correlation between bacterial score and IL-17A+ cells was seen. CONCLUSIONS: In H. pylori infected individuals, the frequencies of IFN{$\gamma$} and IL-17A+ cells were increased in the antrum, particularly in patients with H. pylori induced gastric ulcers. Even though H. pylori colonized both the corpus and antrum regions of the stomach, the cytokine responses and subsequent pathology were mainly detected in the antrum.},

Thus, the feasibility of a vaccine for humans is doubtful. Methods: In two prospective, randomised, double-blind, controlled studies (Paul Ehrlich Institute application nos 0802/02 and 1097/01), live vaccines against H pylori were tested in human volunteers seronegative for, and without evidence of, active H pylori infection. Volunteers (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}58) were immunised orally with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi Ty21a expressing H pylori urease or HP0231, or solely with Ty21a, and then challenged with 2\texttimes 105 cagPAI- H pylori. Adverse events, infection, humoral, cellular and mucosal immune response were monitored. Gastric biopsies were taken before and after vaccination, and postchallenge. Infection was terminated with antibiotics. Results: Vaccines were well tolerated. Challenge infection induced transient, mild to moderate dyspeptic symptoms, and histological and transcriptional changes in the mucosa known from chronic infection. Vaccines did not show satisfactory protection. However, 13 of 58 volunteers, 8 vaccinees and 5 controls, became breath test negative and either cleared H pylori (5/13) completely or reduced the H pylori burden (8/13). H pylori-specific T helper cells were detected in 9 of these 13 (69\%), but only in 6 of 45 (13\%) breath test-positive volunteers (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.0002; Fisher exact test). T cells were either vaccine induced or pre-existing, depending on the volunteer. Conclusion: Challenge infection offers a controlled model for vaccine testing. Importantly, it revealed evidence for T cell-mediated immunity against H pylori infection in humans.},

The large-scale sequencing of the human and other vertebrate genomes has revealed the presence of additional genes encoding proteins clearly related to IL-17, thus defining a new family of cytokines. There are at least six members of the IL-17 family in humans and in mice. Initial characterization suggests that like IL-17, several of these newly identified molecules have the ability to modulate immune function. Neither the IL-17 family nor the cognate receptors that have been identified for these molecules bear obvious sequence similarity to other known families of proteins. Thus, they represent a distinct signaling system that appears to have been highly conserved across vertebrate evolution. The potent inflammatory actions that have been identified for several of these factors and the emerging associations with major human diseases suggest that these proteins may have significant roles in inflammatory processes.},

Despite increasing evidence that high levels of IL-17 are associated with several chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis, the regulation of its expression is not well characterized. We observe that IL-17 production is increased in response to the recently described cytokine IL-23. We present evidence that murine IL-23, which is produced by activated dendritic cells, acts on memory T cells, resulting in elevated IL-17 secretion. IL-23 also induced expression of the related cytokine IL-17F. IL-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine and shares a subunit, p40, with IL-12. In contrast to IL-23, IL-12 had only marginal effects on IL-17 production. These data suggest that during a secondary immune response, IL-23 can promote an activation state with features distinct from the well characterized Th1 and Th2 profiles.},

A novel clustering method is proposed which estimates mutual information based on information potential computed pair-wise between data points and without any prior assumptions about cluster density function. The proposed algorithm increases the mutual information in each step in an agglomerative hierarchy scheme. We have shown experimentally that maximizing mutual information between data points and their class labels will lead to an efficient clustering. Experiments done on a variety of artificial and real datasets show the superiority of this algorithm, besides its low computational complexity, in comparison to other information based clustering methods and also some ordinary clustering algorithms.},

The type of adaptive immune T cell response generated is dependent upon the type of PRR activated by the microbes. Dectin-1 is a C-type lectin receptor present on dendritic cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we show that selective dectin-1 agonist Curdlan can activate human DCs and induce the secretion of large amounts of IL-23, IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6 and low levels of IL-12p70 as determined by ELISA. The Curdlan-stimulated DCs are efficient at priming na\"ive CD4 cells to differentiate into Th17 and Th1 cells. Furthermore, these CD4 T cells induce differentiation of B cells to secrete IgG and IgA. In addition, Curdlan-stimulated DCs promote the expansion and differentiation of Granzyme and perforin expressing cytotoxic T lymphocyte that display high cytolytic activity against target tumor cells in vitro. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data demonstrate that DCs stimulated through Dectin-1 can generate efficient Th, CTL and B cell responses and can therefore be used as effective mucosal and systemic adjuvants in humans.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Atrophic gastritis (AG) results most often from Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. AG is the most important single risk condition for gastric cancer that often leads to an acid-free or hypochlorhydric stomach. In the present paper, we suggest a rationale for noninvasive screening of AG with stomach-specific biomarkers. METHODS: The paper summarizes a set of data on application of the biomarkers and describes how the test results could be interpreted in practice. RESULTS: In AG of the gastric corpus and fundus, the plasma levels of pepsinogen I and/or the pepsinogen I/pepsinogen II ratio are always low. The fasting level of gastrin-17 is high in AG limited to the corpus and fundus, but low or non-elevated if the AG occurs in both antrum and corpus. A low fasting level of G-17 is a sign of antral AG or indicates high intragastric acidity. Differentiation between antral AG and high intragastric acidity can be done by assaying the plasma G-17 before and after protein stimulation, or before and after administration of the proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Amidated G-17 will rise if the antral mucosa is normal in structure. H. pylori antibodies are a reliable indicator of helicobacter infection, even in patients with AG and hypochlorhydria. CONCLUSIONS: Stomach-specific biomarkers provide information about the stomach health and about the function of stomach mucosa and are a noninvasive tool for diagnosis and screening of AG and acid-free stomach.},

The aim of this study was to determine whether the quantitative PCR combined with propidium monoazide could be an alternative and good technique to determine H. pylori viability in environmental samples and, to contribute to understanding of the role of the H. pylori forms.Materials and Methods: Viability, morphological distribution, and the number of live H. pylori cells were determined using a propidium monoazide-based quantitative PCR method, at various time points.Results: Under adverse environmental conditions was observed the conversion of H. pylori from the bacillary to the coccoid form, and the decrease in amplification signal, in samples that were treated with propidium monoazide, over the time.Conclusions: Incorporation of propidium monoazide indicates that there is an increase in H. pylori cells with the damaged membrane over the study, leading to the manifestation of cellular degeneration and death. Consequently, quantitative PCR combined with propidium monoazide contributes to our understanding of the role of H. pylori cells, under adverse environmental conditions.},

Our telomere length estimates were determined from the background-corrected telomere intensity divided by the background-corrected centromere intensity (telomere-to-centromere ratio). Our results indicated that telomere lengths in each of the cases studied were reduced in turn from fibroblasts to fundic gland cells, to glandular neck cells, and then to surface foveolar cells. However, the telomere lengths of intestinalized cells located among fundic glands were not always shorter than those of the other cell types, as reported previously by others. Helicobacter pylori infection was suggested to induce the telomere shortening seen in the fundic glands. Although the mean telomere lengths varied among the 8 gastric cancer cases, correlation of the telomere lengths with the Ki-67 labeling index was established after normalization with the fibroblast measurements. We conclude that our telomere-to-centromere ratio method can reliably estimate the telomere lengths of the 6 cell types in the gastric mucosa and clarifies the relationship between proliferative activity and the telomere length of cancer cells.},

Subsets of immune and inflammatory cells interact via ILs and IFNs; reciprocal regulation and counter balance among T(h) and regulatory T cells, as well as subsets of B cells, offer opportunities for immune interventions. Here, we review current knowledge about ILs 1 to 37 and IFN-{$\gamma$}. Our understanding of the effects of ILs has greatly increased since the discoveries of monocyte IL (called IL-1) and lymphocyte IL (called IL-2); more than 40 cytokines are now designated as ILs. Studies of transgenic or knockout mice with altered expression of these cytokines or their receptors and analyses of mutations and polymorphisms in human genes that encode these products have provided important information about IL and IFN functions. We discuss their signaling pathways, cellular sources, targets, roles in immune regulation and cellular networks, roles in allergy and asthma, and roles in defense against infections.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Abs have been considered a correlate rather than an effector of resistance against Helicobacter pylori infection. However, it is still poorly understood to what extent Ab production correlates with gastric immunopathology. Here we report that Abs not only are dispensable for protection, but they are detrimental to elimination of the bacteria and appear to impair gastric inflammatory responses. We found that the initial colonization with H. pylori bacteria was normal in the B cell-deficient (microMT) mice, whereas at later times ({$>$}8 wk) most of the bacteria were cleared, concomitant with the development of severe gastritis. In contrast, wild-type (WT) mice exhibited extensive bacterial colonization and only mild gastric inflammation, even at 16 wk after inoculation. Oral immunizations with H. pylori lysate and cholera toxin adjuvant stimulated comparable levels of protection in microMT and WT mice. The level of protection in both strains correlated well with the severity of the postimmunization gastritis. Thus, T cells were responsible for the gastritis, whereas Abs, including potentially host cell cross-reactive Abs, were not involved in causing the gastritis. The T cells in micro MT and WT mice produced high and comparable levels of IFN-gamma to recall Ag at 2 and after 8 wk, whereas IL-4 was detected after 8 wk only, indicating that Th1 activity dominated the early phase of protection, whereas later a mixed Th1 and Th2 activity was seen.},

  abstract = {The regulatory roles of Th1 and Th2 cells in immune protection against Helicobacter infection are not clearly understood. In this study, we report that a primary H. pylori infection can be established in the absence of IL-12 or IFN-gamma. However, IFN-gamma, but not IL-12, was involved in the development of gastritis because IFN-gamma(-/-) (GKO) mice exhibited significantly less inflammation as compared with IL-12(-/-) or wild-type (WT) mice. Both IL-12(-/-) and GKO mice failed to develop protection following oral immunization with H. pylori lysate and cholera toxin adjuvant. By contrast, Th2-deficient, IL-4(-/-), and WT mice were equally well protected. Mucosal immunization in the presence of coadministered rIL-12 in WT mice increased Ag-specific IFN-gamma-producing T cells by 5-fold and gave an additional 4-fold reduction in colonizing bacteria, confirming a key role of Th1 cells in protection. Importantly, only protected IL-4(-/-) and WT mice demonstrated substantial influx of CD4(+) T cells in the gastric mucosa. The extent of inflammation in challenged IL-12(-/-) and GKO mice was much reduced compared with that in WT mice, indicating that IFN-gamma/Th1 cells also play a major role in postimmunization gastritis. Of note, postimmunization gastritis in IL-4(-/-) mice was significantly milder than WT mice, despite a similar level of protection, indicating that immune protection is not directly linked to the degree of gastric inflammation. Only protected mice had T cells that produced high levels of IFN-gamma to recall Ag, whereas both protected and unprotected mice produced high levels of IL-13. We conclude that IL-12 and Th1 responses are crucial for H. pylori-specific protective immunity.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in an expanding group of cytokines known as ``IL-12 family''. The so far gained knowledge about these cytokines, as crucial playmakers in mucosal immunity, has not yet been sufficiently investigated in the context of Helicobacter pylori infection. All genes encoding the monomeric components of these cytokines and their corresponding receptors were examined in gastric epithelial cell lines (AGS and MKN-28) after being infected with 4 H. pylori strains: BCM-300, P1 wild-type, and P1-derived isogenic mutants lacking cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA) or virulence gene virB7 (multiplicity of infection=50). Both infected and uninfected samples were analyzed after 24h and 48h using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Gene expression analysis demonstrated a strong upregulation of IL23A (encodes p19) by infection, whereas IL23R, Epstein\textendash Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3), IL6ST, IL12A, and IL27RA were found to be expressed, but not regulated, or to a lesser extent. Transcripts of IL12RB2, IL12B, IL12RB1, and IL27A were not detected. Interestingly, P1 resulted in stronger alterations of expression than CagA mutant and BCM-300, particularly for IL23A (59.7-fold versus 32.4- and 6.7-fold, respectively in AGS after 48h, P{$<$}.05), whereas no changes were seen with VirB7 mutant. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrated epithelial-derived expression of IL-12, p19, and Ebi3 in gastric mucosa of gastritis patients using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Unlike IL-12 and Ebi3, increased immunostaining of p19 was observed in H. pylori gastritis. Herein, we highlight the potential role of gastric epithelial cells in mucosal immunity, not only because they are predominant cell type in mucosa and initial site of host-bacterial interaction, but also as a major contributor to molecules that are thought to be primarily expressed by immune cells so far. Of these molecules, p19 was the most relevant one to H. pylori infection in terms of expression and localization.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter species are fastidious bacterial pathogens that are difficult to culture by standard methods. A PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) technique for detection and identification of different Helicobacter species was developed and evaluated. The method involves PCR detection of Helicobacter DNA by genus-specific primers that target 16S rDNA and subsequent differentiation of Helicobacter PCR products by use of DGGE. Strains are identified by comparing mobilities of unknown samples to those determined for reference strains; sequence analysis can also be performed on purified amplicons. Sixteen DGGE profiles were derived from 44 type and reference strains of 20 Helicobacter species, indicating the potential of this approach for resolving infection of a single host by multiple Helicobacter species. Some more highly related species were not differentiated whereas in highly heterogeneous species, sequence divergence was observed and more than one PCR-DGGE profile was obtained. Application of the PCR-DGGE method to DNA extracted from faeces of zoo animals revealed the presence of Helicobacter DNA in 13 of 16 samples; a correlation was seen between the mobility of PCR products in DGGE analysis and DNA sequencing. In combination, this indicated that zoo animals are colonized by a wide range of different Helicobacter species; seven animals appeared to be colonized by multiple Helicobacter species. By this approach, presumptive identifications were made of Helicobacter bilis and Helicobacter hepaticus in a Nile crocodile, Helicobacter cinaedi in a baboon and a red panda, and Helicobacter felis in a wolf and a Taiwan beauty snake. All of these PCR products ( approximately 400 bp) showed 100 \% sequence similarity to 16S rDNA sequences of the mentioned species. These results demonstrate the potential of PCR-DGGE-based analysis for identification of Helicobacter species in complex ecosystems, such as the gastrointestinal tract, and could contribute to a better understanding of the ecology of helicobacters and other pathogens with a complex aetiology.},

This review focuses on the immune response to H. pylori and the mechanisms by which H. pylori resists immune clearance. Three main sections of the review are devoted to (i) analysis of the immune response to H. pylori in humans, (ii) analysis of interactions of H. pylori with host immune defenses in animal models, and (iii) interactions of H. pylori with immune cells in vitro. The topics addressed in this review are important for understanding how H. pylori resists immune clearance and also are relevant for understanding the pathogenesis of diseases caused by H. pylori (peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric lymphoma).},

Within the first 2 days after orogastric infection of mice with H. pylori, there was a transient infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils into the glandular stomach. By day 10 postinfection, the numbers of macrophages and neutrophils decreased to baseline levels. By 3 weeks postinfection, an adaptive immune response was detected, marked by gastric infiltration of T lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, as well as increased numbers of H. pylori-specific T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells in paragastric lymph nodes. Neutrophil-attracting and macrophage-attracting chemokines were expressed at higher levels in the stomachs of H. pylori-infected mice than in the stomachs of uninfected mice. Increased expression of TNFalpha and IFNgamma (Th1-type inflammatory cytokines) and IL-17 (a Th17-type cytokine) was detected in the stomachs of H. pylori-infected mice, but increased expression of IL-4 (a Th2-type cytokine) was not detected. These data indicate that a transient gastric inflammatory response to H. pylori occurs within the first few days after infection, before the priming of T cells and initiation of an adaptive immune response. It is speculated that inappropriate waning of the innate immune response during early stages of infection may be a factor that contributes to H. pylori persistence.},

In this study, we investigated the role of IL-17 signaling in chronic gastric inflammation induced by Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative bacterium that persistently colonizes the human stomach. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice and mice lacking IL-17RA (IL-17RA(-/-)) were orogastrically infected with H. pylori. Differences in bacterial colonization density and gastric inflammation were not apparent at 1 mo postinfection, but by 3 mo postinfection, H. pylori colonization density was higher and mononuclear gastric inflammation more severe in infected IL-17RA(-/-) mice than in infected wild-type mice. A striking feature was a marked increase in gastric B cells, plasma cells, and lymphoid follicles, along with enhanced H. pylori-specific serum Ab responses, in infected IL-17RA(-/-) mice. Fewer gastric neutrophils and lower levels of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines were detected in infected IL-17RA(-/-) mice than in infected wild-type mice. Gastric IL-17a and IL-21 transcript levels were significantly higher in infected IL-17RA(-/-) mice than in infected wild-type mice or uninfected mice, which suggested that a negative feedback loop was impaired in the IL-17RA(-/-) mice. These results underscore an important role of IL-17RA signaling in regulating B cell recruitment. In contrast to many chronic inflammatory diseases in which IL-17RA signaling promotes an inflammatory response, IL-17RA signaling down-regulates the chronic mononuclear inflammation elicited by H. pylori infection.},

Most orthologous protein pairs (equivalent genes between two genomes, same function) shared considerable identity between the two strains. The unusual set of outer membrane proteins and the specialized outer membrane may be a reflection of the adaptation of H. pylori to the unique gastric environment where it is found. One subfamily of proteins, which contains both channel-forming and adhesin molecules, is extremely highly related at the sequence level and has likely arisen due to ancestral gene duplication. In addition, the largest paralogous family contained two essentially identical pairs of genes in both strains. The presence and genomic organization of these two pairs of duplicated genes were analyzed in a panel of independent H. pylori isolates. While one pair was present in every strain examined, one allele of the other pair appeared partially deleted in several isolates.},

Colonization induces chronic gastric inflammation which can progress to a variety of diseases, ranging in severity from superficial gastritis and peptic ulcer to gastric cancer and mucosal-associated lymphoma. Strain-specific genetic diversity has been proposed to be involved in the organism's ability to cause different diseases or even be beneficial to the infected host and to participate in the lifelong chronicity of infection. Here we compare the complete genomic sequences of two unrelated H. pylori isolates. This is, to our knowledge, the first such genomic comparison. H. pylori was believed to exhibit a large degree of genomic and allelic diversity, but we find that the overall genomic organization, gene order and predicted proteomes (sets of proteins encoded by the genomes) of the two strains are quite similar. Between 6 to 7\% of the genes are specific to each strain, with almost half of these genes being clustered in a single hypervariable region.},

  abstract = {To investigate the vaccine potential of H. pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS), truncated LPS of H. pylori strain 26695 HP0826::Kan lacking O-chain polysaccharide and comprising an extended {$\alpha$}-1,6-linked glucan chain was conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TT) or bovine serum albumin (BSA). Two approaches were used for delipidation or partial delipidation of H. pylori LPS: (1) mild hydrolysis resulting in delipidated LPS (dLPS) and (2) treatment with anhydrous hydrazine resulting in removal of O-linked fatty acids (LPS-OH). Both LPS-OH and dLPS were covalently linked through a 2-keto-3-deoxy-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residue to a diamino group-containing spacer, followed by conjugation to thiolated TT or BSA to give conjugates LPS-OH-TT, dLPS-BSA and dLPS-TT, respectively. The LPS-OH-TT, dLPS-BSA and dLPS-TT conjugates were immunogenic in both rabbits and mice, inducing strong and specific IgG responses against homologous and heterologous strains of H. pylori. Moreover, the rabbit post-immune sera showed cross-reactivity against clinical isolates of H. pylori in a whole-cell indirect ELISA, which was further confirmed by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy. A tenfold stronger IgG immune response to the immunizing antigen was generated in mice and rabbits that received dLPS-containing conjugate. The post-immune sera of rabbits immunized with LPS-OH-TT, dLPS-BSA or dLPS-TT displayed significant bactericidal activity against mutant and wild-type {$\alpha$}-1,6-glucan-expressing strains and selected clinical isolates of H. pylori. Finally, partial protection against H. pylori challenge was demonstrated in mice vaccinated with dLPS-TT conjugate adjuvanted with cholera toxin. In summary, this study shows that glycoconjugates based on delipidated or partially delipidated LPS from H. pylori 26695 HP0826::Kan mutant induce broadly cross-reactive functional antibodies in immunized animals and should be considered for further vaccine development and testing.},

However, the IL-23 signaling cascade remains largely undefined. Here, we used quantitative phosphoproteomics to characterize IL-23 signaling in primary murine Th17 cells. We quantified 6,888 phosphorylation sites in Th17 cells and found 168 phosphorylations regulated upon IL-23 stimulation. IL-23 increased the phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC), an actomyosin contractibility marker, in Th17 and T{$\gamma\delta$}17 cells. IL-23-induced RLC phosphorylation required Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) catalytic activity, and further study of the IL-23/ROCK connection revealed an unexpected role of IL-23 in the migration of T{$\gamma\delta$}17 and Th17 cells through ROCK activation. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of ROCK reduced T{$\gamma\delta$}17 recruitment to inflamed skin upon challenge with inflammatory agent Imiquimod. This work (i) provides new insights into phosphorylation networks that control Th17 cells, (ii) widely expands the current knowledge on IL-23 signaling, and (iii) contributes to the increasing list of immune cells subsets characterized by global phosphoproteomic approaches.},

Here we report their involvement in human uveitis and scleritis, and validate our findings in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), a model of uveitis. T(H)17 cells were present in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and were expanded by interleukin (IL)-2 and inhibited by interferon (IFN)-gamma. Their numbers increased during active uveitis and scleritis and decreased following treatment. IL-17 was elevated in EAU and upregulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in retinal cells, suggesting a mechanism by which T(H)17 may contribute to ocular pathology. Furthermore, IL-27 was constitutively expressed in retinal ganglion and photoreceptor cells, was upregulated by IFN-gamma and inhibited proliferation of T(H)17. These findings suggest that T(H)1 cells may mitigate uveitis by antagonizing the T(H)17 phenotype through the IFN-gamma-mediated induction of IL-27 in target tissue. The finding that IL-2 promotes T(H)17 expansion provides explanations for the efficacy of IL-2R antibody therapy in uveitis, and suggests that antagonism of T(H)17 by IFN-gamma and/or IL-27 could be used for the treatment of chronic inflammation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have suggested that gastro-intestinal infections including Helicobacter pylori, intestinal microflora (commensal bacteria) and geohelminths may influence the risk of asthma and allergy but data from early life are lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the independent effects of these infections on allergic disease symptoms and sensitization in an Ethiopian birth cohort. METHODS: In 2008/09, 878 children (87\% of the 1006 original singletons in a population-based birth cohort) were followed up at age 3 and interview data obtained on allergic symptoms and potential confounders. Allergen skin tests to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and cockroach were performed, levels of Der p 1 and Bla g 1 in the child's bedding measured and stool samples analysed for geohelminths and, in a random subsample, enterococci, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and H. pylori antigen. The independent effects of each exposure on wheeze, eczema, hayfever and sensitization were determined using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Children were commonly infected with H. pylori (41\%; 253/616), enterococci (38.1\%; 207/544), lactobacilli (31.1\%; 169/544) and bifidobacteria (18.9\%; 103/544) whereas geohelminths were only found in 8.5\% (75/866). H. pylori infection was associated with a borderline significant reduced risk of eczema (adjusted OR 0.49, 95\% CI 0.24-1.01, P=0.05) and D. pteronyssinus sensitization (adjusted OR 0.42, 95\% CI 0.17-1.08, P=0.07). Geohelminths and intestinal microflora were not significantly associated with any of the outcomes measured. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Among young children in a developing country, we found evidence to support the hypothesis of a protective effect of H. pylori infection on the risk of allergic disease. Further investigation of the mechanism of this effect is therefore of potential therapeutic and preventive value.},

We report here that HP-NAP is a TLR2 agonist able to induce the expression of IL-12 and IL-23 by neutrophils and monocytes. Addition in culture of HP-NAP, as an immune modulator, to antigen-induced T cell lines resulted in a remarkable increase in the number of IFN-gamma-producing T cells and decrease of IL-4-secreting cells, thus shifting the cytokine profile of antigen-activated human T cells from Th2 to a Th1 cytotoxic phenotype. We also found that in vivo HP-NAP elicited an antigen-specific Th1-polarized T cell response in the gastric mucosa of H. pylori-infected patients. These data indicate HP-NAP as an important factor of H. pylori able to elicit cells of the innate immune system to produce IL-12 and IL-23, and they suggest it as a new tool for promoting Th1 immune responses.},

They have evolved intricate mechanisms to avoid the bactericidal acid in the gastric lumen and to survive near, to attach to, and to communicate with the human gastric epithelium and host immune system. This interaction sometimes results in severe gastric pathology. H pylori infection is the strongest known risk factor for the development of gastroduodenal ulcers, with infection being present in 60\%-80\% of gastric and 95\% of duodenal ulcers.(1)H pylori is also the first bacterium to be classified as a definite carcinogen by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer because of its epidemiologic relationship to gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.(2) In the last 25 years, since H pylori was first described and cultured, a complete paradigm shift has occurred in our clinical approach to these gastric diseases, and more than 20,000 scientific publications have appeared on the subject. From the medical point of view, H pylori is a formidable pathogen responsible for much morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, H pylori infection occurs in approximately half of the world population, with disease being an exception rather than the rule. Understanding how this organism interacts with its host is essential for formulating an intelligent strategy for dealing with its most important clinical consequences. This review offers an insight into H pylori host-bacterial interactions.},

Despite success with attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhimurium vectors in animals, early clinical trials of S. enterica serovar Typhi expressing heterologous antigens have shown that few subjects have detectable immune responses to vectored antigens. A previous clinical study of phoP/phoQ-deleted S. enterica serovar Typhi expressing Helicobacter pylori urease from a multicopy plasmid showed that none of eight subjects had detectable immune responses to the vectored antigen. In an attempt to further define the variables important for engendering immune responses to vectored antigens in humans, six volunteers were inoculated with 5 x 10(7) to 8 x 10(7) CFU of phoP/phoQ-deleted S. enterica serovar Typhimurium expressing the same antigen. Two of the six volunteers had fever; none had diarrhea, bacteremia, or other serious side effects. The volunteers were more durably colonized than in previous studies of phoP/phoQ-deleted S. enterica serovar Typhi. Five of the six volunteers seroconverted to S. enterica serovar Typhimurium antigens and had strong evidence of anti-Salmonella mucosal immune responses by enzyme-linked immunospot studies. Three of six (three of five who seroconverted to Salmonella) had immune responses in the most sensitive assay of urease-specific immunoglobulin production by blood mononuclear cells in vitro. One of these had a fourfold or greater increase in end-point immunoglobulin titer in serum versus urease. Attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhimurium appears to be more effective than S. enterica serovar Typhi for engendering immune responses to urease. Data suggest that this may be related to a greater stability of antigen-expressing plasmid in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and/or prolonged intestinal colonization. Specific factors unique to nontyphoidal salmonellae may also be important for stimulation of the gastrointestinal immune system.},

Moreover, glycan biosynthesis depends on several highly competitive processes; thus, variations in the concentration of specific glycosyltransferases produce different products. For this reason, monitoring changes in glycosylation may be a more specific and sensitive approach to biomarker discovery and possibly disease diagnosis. Glycans in serum are of particular interest as approximately half of all proteins are glycosylated. We have developed the methods for profiling the glycans in human serum to identify glycan biomarker. Global release methods were used including chemical and enzymatic to access O-linked and N-linked glycans, respectively. Glycans were released from the culture medium of various cancer cell lines, in control sera, and in cancer patients and isolated using solid phase extraction (SPE) with a porous graphitized carbon. The SPE fractions were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (MALDI FTICR MS). Glycan compositions were determined based on accurate masses and tandem mass spectrometry. Glycosylation changes between control and patient group were monitored. Several glycans were identified as potential markers for ovarian, breast, and prostate cancer. In short, direct glycan analysis of human serum without any protein identification represents a new and innovative approach to disease marker discovery.},

We have identified CD4(+)CD25(-)Foxp3(-) T cells as the major source of IL-10 in the VL spleen. IL-27, a member of the IL-6/IL-12 cytokine family, has been shown to promote development of IL-10-producing T cells, in part by upregulating their production of autocrine IL-21. We investigated whether IL-27 and IL-21 are associated with human VL. IL-27 was elevated in VL plasma, and at pretreatment, spleen cells showed significantly elevated mRNA levels of both IL-27 subunits, IL-27p28 and EBI-3, as well as IL-21, compared with posttreatment biopsies. CD14(+) spleen cells were the main source of IL-27 mRNA, whereas CD3(+) T cells were the main source of IL-21. IL-27 mRNA could be strongly upregulated in normal donor macrophages with IFN-{$\gamma$} and IL-1{$\beta$}, conditions consistent with those in the VL spleen. Last, a whole-blood assay revealed that most VL patients could produce Ag-specific IFN-{$\gamma$} and IL-10 and that the IL-10 could be augmented with recombinant human IL-21. Thus, proinflammatory cytokines acting on macrophages in the VL spleen have the potential to upregulate IL-27, which in turn can induce IL-21 to expand IL-10-producing T cells as a mechanism of feedback control.},

The transcription factor c-Maf is essential for the induction of IL-10 by Tr1 cells, but the molecular mechanisms that lead to the development of these cells remain unclear. Here we show that the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which was induced by IL-27, acted in synergy with c-Maf to promote the development of Tr1 cells. After T cell activation under Tr1-skewing conditions, the AhR bound to c-Maf and promoted transactivation of the Il10 and Il21 promoters, which resulted in the generation of Tr1 cells and the amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Manipulating AhR signaling could therefore be beneficial in the resolution of excessive inflammatory responses.},

However, manual interpretation of MS data is complex and tedious due to large number of product ions observed and also due to the variation in their m/z values under various experimental conditions. We present an automated tool, SimGlycan, for this purpose, which accepts raw/standard MS data files as input and characterizes the associated glycan structure with high accuracy using database searching and scoring techniques. Not only does it predict the glycan structure using an MS/MS database searching technique, but it also facilitates predicting novel glycans by drawing a glycan and mapping it onto an experimental spectrum to check the degree of proximity between the theoretical and the experimental glycans. It serves as a platform for developing advanced tools that may be used for glycopeptide identification using MS data and 3D structural analysis of glycans with a few improvements in the existing features.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY: The interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-18, and IL-33 families of cytokines are related by mechanism of origin, receptor structure, and signal transduction pathways utilized. All three cytokines are synthesized as precursor molecules and cleaved by the enzyme caspase-1 before or during release from the cell. The NALP-3 inflammasome is of crucial importance in generating active caspase-1. The IL-1 family contains two agonists, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, a specific inhibitor, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and two receptors, the biologically active type IL-1R and inactive type II IL-1R. Both IL-1RI and IL-33R utilize the same interacting accessory protein (IL-1RAcP). The balance between IL-1 and IL-1Ra is important in preventing disease in various organs, and excess production of IL-1 has been implicated in many human diseases. The IL-18 family also contains a specific inhibitor, the IL-18-binding protein (IL-18BP), which binds IL-18 in the fluid phase. The IL-18 receptor is similar to the IL-1 receptor complex, including a single ligand-binding chain and a different interacting accessory protein. IL-18 provides an important link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Newly described IL-33 binds to the orphan IL-1 family receptor T1/ST2 and stimulates T-helper 2 responses as well as mast cells.},

A similar dependence of type 1 immunity on CD103+ DCs is observed in a Mycobacterium bovis BCG infection model, and in a syngeneic colon cancer model. Strikingly, we find that not only the expansion and/or recruitment of Th1 cells, but also of peripherally induced, neuropilin-negative regulatory T-cells to sites of infection requires BATF3-dependent DCs. A shared feature of the examined models is the strongly reduced production of the chemokines and CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, 10 and 11 in BATF3-deficient mice. The results implicate BATF3-dependent DCs in the recruitment of CXCR3+ effector and regulatory T-cells to target tissues and in their local expansion.},

The increase in asthma rates has been linked epidemiologically to the rapid disappearance of Helicobacter pylori, a bacterial pathogen that persistently colonizes the human stomach, from Western societies. In this study, we have utilized mouse models of allergic airway disease induced by ovalbumin or house dust mite allergen to experimentally examine a possible inverse correlation between H. pylori and asthma. H. pylori infection efficiently protected mice from airway hyperresponsiveness, tissue inflammation, and goblet cell metaplasia, which are hallmarks of asthma, and prevented allergen-induced pulmonary and bronchoalveolar infiltration with eosinophils, Th2 cells, and Th17 cells. Protection against asthma was most robust in mice infected neonatally and was abrogated by antibiotic eradication of H. pylori. Asthma protection was further associated with impaired maturation of lung-infiltrating dendritic cells and the accumulation of highly suppressive Tregs in the lungs. Systemic Treg depletion abolished asthma protection; conversely, the adoptive transfer of purified Treg populations was sufficient to transfer protection from infected donor mice to uninfected recipients. Our results thus provide experimental evidence for a beneficial effect of H. pylori colonization on the development of allergen-induced asthma.},

WSX-1-/- mice infected with the gastrointestinal helminth Trichuris muris displayed accelerated expulsion of parasites and the development of exaggerated goblet cell hyperplasia and mastocytosis in the gut due to increased production of Th2 cytokines. Enhanced mast cell activity in the absence of WSX-1 was consistent with the ability of wild-type mast cells to express this receptor. In addition, IL-27 directly suppressed CD4+ T cell proliferation and Th2 cytokine production. Together, these studies identify a novel role for IL-27/WSX-1 in limiting innate and adaptive components of type 2 immunity at mucosal sites.},

By in situ hybridization, H. pylori bacteria were observed in close association with erythrocytes in capillaries and post-capillary venules of the lamina propria of gastric mucosa in both infected humans and Rhesus monkeys. In vivo adherence of H. pylori to erythrocytes may require molecular mechanisms similar to the sialic acid-dependent in vitro agglutination of erythrocytes (i.e., sialic acid-dependent hemagglutination). In this context, the SabA adhesin was identified as the sialic acid-dependent hemagglutinin based on sialidase-sensitive hemagglutination, binding assays with sialylated glycoconjugates, and analysis of a series of isogenic sabA deletion mutants. The topographic presentation of binding sites for SabA on the erythrocyte membrane was mapped to gangliosides with extended core chains. However, receptor mapping revealed that the NeuAcalpha2-3Gal-disaccharide constitutes the minimal sialylated binding epitope required for SabA binding. Furthermore, clinical isolates demonstrated polymorphism in sialyl binding and complementation analysis of sabA mutants demonstrated that polymorphism in sialyl binding is an inherent property of the SabA protein itself. Gastric inflammation is associated with periodic changes in the composition of mucosal sialylation patterns. We suggest that dynamic adaptation in sialyl-binding properties during persistent infection specializes H. pylori both for individual variation in mucosal glycosylation and tropism for local areas of inflamed and/or dysplastic tissue.},

H. pylori genes encoding these and other factors rapidly evolve through mutation and recombination, changing the bacteria-host interaction. Although immune and physiologic responses to H. pylori also contribute to pathogenesis, humans have evolved in concert with the bacterium, and its recent absence throughout the life of many individuals has led to new human physiological changes.

To address the role of IL-23 in vivo, we have generated a novel "knock-in" mouse in which we have replaced the intracellular domain of the IL-23R with the GFP. We show that in addition to Th17 cells, a subset of myeloid cells express IL-23R and respond to IL-23 by producing IL-17 and IL-22.

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a successful pathogen that can persist in the stomach of an infected person for their entire life. It provokes chronic gastric inflammation that leads to the development of serious gastric diseases such as peptic ulcers, gastric cancer and Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. It is known that these ailments can be avoided if the infection by the bacteria can be prevented or eradicated. Currently, numerous antibiotic-based therapies are available. However, these therapies have several inherent problems, including the appearance of resistance to the antibiotics used and associated adverse effects, the risk of re-infection and the high cost of antibiotic therapy. The delay in developing a vaccine to prevent or eradicate the infection has furthered research into new therapeutic approaches. This review summarises the most relevant recent studies on vaccine development and new treatments using natural resources such as plants, probiotics and nutraceuticals. In addition, novel alternatives based on microorganisms, peptides, polysaccharides, and intragastric violet light irradiation are presented. Alternative therapies have not been effective in eradicating the bacteria but have been shown to maintain low bacterial levels. Nevertheless, some of them are useful in preventing the adverse effects of antibiotics, modulating the immune response, gastroprotection, and the general promotion of health. Therefore, those agents can be used as adjuvants of allopathic anti-H. pylori eradication therapy.},

  abstract = {Definition of gastritis has its basis in histological features of the gastric mucosa. It is not erythema observed during gastroscopy, and there are no specific clinical presentations or symptoms defining it. The current classification of gastritis centers on time course (acute versus chronic), histological features, anatomic distribution, and underlying pathological mechanisms. Acute gastritis will evolve to chronic, if not treated. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the most common cause of gastritis worldwide. However, 60 to 70\% of H. pylori-negative subjects with functional dyspepsia or non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux were also found to have gastritis. H. pylori-negative gastritis is a consideration when an individual fulfill all four of these criteria (i) A negative triple staining of gastric mucosal biopsies (hematoxylin and eosin, Alcian blue stain and a modified silver stain), (ii) A negative H pylori culture, (iii) A negative IgG H. pylori serology, and (iv) No self-reported history of H. pylori treatment. In these patients, the cause of gastritis may relate to tobacco smoking, consumption of alcohol, and/or the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or steroids. Other causes of gastritis include: 1. Autoimmune gastritis associated with serum anti-parietal and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies; characterized by chronic atrophic gastritis limited to the corpus and fundus of the stomach that is causing marked diffuse atrophy of parietal and chief cells. 2. Gastritis causes include organisms other than H. pylori such as Mycobacterium avium intracellulare, Herpes simplex, and Cytomegalovirus. 3. Gastritis caused by acid reflux. Rare causes of gastritis include collagenous gastritis, sarcoidosis, eosinophilic gastritis, and lymphocytic gastritis. Clinical presentation, laboratory investigations, gastroscopy, as well as the histological and microbiological examination of tissue biopsies are essential for the diagnosis of gastritis and its causes. Treatment of H. pylori-associated gastritis results in the rapid disappearance of polymorphonuclear infiltration and a reduction of chronic inflammatory infiltrate with the gradual normalization of the mucosa. Mucosal atrophy and metaplastic changes may resolve shortly, but it is not necessarily the outcome of treatment of H. pylori in all treated patients. Other types of gastritis should be treated based on their causative etiology.},

To investigate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the p35 gene, we characterized murine p35 expression in the B cell lymphoma line A20 and in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Multiple transcription start sites were identified in both cell types, resulting in four p35 mRNA isoforms (types I-IV) that differ in the number and position of upstream ATGs in their 5' untranslated regions. In nonstimulated cells, the predominant forms of p35 message (types II and IV) contained an additional upstream ATG, whose presence was shown to inhibit the downstream translation of the p35 subunit. After LPS stimulation, however, transcription initiated from alternate positions, so that the proportion of transcripts not containing this upstream ATG (types I and III) was significantly increased in the population of p35 mRNA. These type I and type III transcripts readily supported translation of the p35 subunit and its incorporation into bioactive IL-12. Furthermore, p35 mRNA levels were substantially up-regulated after LPS stimulation in both cell types. Thus, our results show that p35 gene expression is highly regulated by both transcriptional and translational mechanisms.},

The objective of this study was to compare the profile of mucins in the progressive stages of H. pylori infected pre-neoplastic and neoplastic human gastric epithelium. We used a panel of monoclonal antibodies with well-defined specificities of MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC6 to characterize the expression pattern of mucins by immunohistochemistry. METHODS: RUT and ELISA were down for H. pylori confirmation. Human gastric biopsy sections were stained using immunohistochemistry with MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC6 antibodies. RESULTS: MUC5AC was expressed in the superficial epithelium and the upper part of the gastric pits. MUC6 expression was detected in the lower part of the gastric glands. MUC2 was expressed in intestinal metaplasia, mostly in goblet cells. The mucin expression profile in the progressive stages of H. pylori infected human gastric epithelium allows the identification of intestinal metaplasia, which is characterized by a decreased expression of the gastric mucins (MUC5AC and MUC6) and de novo expression of MUC2. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our results suggest that there is altered expression of MUC5AC and MUC6 together with the aberrant expression of MUC2 in intestinal metaplasia, during the process of gastric carcinogenesis. The present study indicates that the MUC2 mucin expression pattern is a reliable marker of intestinal metaplasia, which appears in the context of H. pylori infected individuals.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is a highly successful pathogen uniquely adapted to colonize humans. Gastric infections with this bacterium can induce pathology ranging from chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers to gastric cancer. More virulent H. pylori isolates harbour numerous well-known adhesins (BabA/B, SabA, AlpA/B, OipA and HopZ) and the cag (cytotoxin-associated genes) pathogenicity island encoding a type IV secretion system (T4SS). The adhesins establish tight bacterial contact with host target cells and the T4SS represents a needle-like pilus device for the delivery of effector proteins into host target cells such as CagA. BabA and SabA bind to blood group antigen and sialylated proteins respectively, and a series of T4SS components including CagI, CagL, CagY and CagA have been shown to target the integrin {$\beta$}1 receptor followed by injection of CagA across the host cell membrane. The interaction of CagA with membrane-anchored phosphatidylserine may also play a role in the delivery process. While substantial progress has been made in our current understanding of many of the above factors, the host cell receptors for OipA, HopZ and AlpA/B during infection are still unknown. Here we review the recent progress in characterizing the interactions of the various adhesins and structural T4SS proteins with host cell factors. The contribution of these interactions to H. pylori colonization and pathogenesis is discussed.},

  abstract = {Several bacterial pathogens inject virulence proteins into host target cells that are substrates of eukaryotic tyrosine kinases. One of the key examples is the Helicobacter pylori CagA effector protein which is translocated by a type-IV secretion system. Injected CagA becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated on EPIYA sequence motifs by Src and Abl family kinases. CagA then binds to and activates/inactivates multiple signaling proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent and phosphorylation-independent manner. A recent proteomic screen systematically identified eukaryotic binding partners of the EPIYA phosphorylation sites of CagA and similar sites in other bacterial effectors by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Individual phosphorylation sites recruited a surprisingly high number of interaction partners suggesting that each phosphorylation site can interfere with many downstream pathways. We now count 20 reported cellular binding partners of CagA, which represents the highest quantitiy among all yet known virulence-associated effector proteins in the microbial world. This complexity generates a highly remarkable and puzzling scenario. In addition, the first crystal structure of CagA provided us with new information on the function of this important virulence determinant. Here we review the recent advances in characterizing the multiple binding signaling activities of CagA. Injected CagA can act as a 'master key' that evolved the ability to highjack multiple host cell signalling cascades, which include the induction of membrane dynamics, actin-cytoskeletal rearrangements and the disruption of cell-to-cell junctions as well as proliferative, pro-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic nuclear responses. The discovery that different pathogens use this common strategy to subvert host cell functions suggests that more examples will emerge soon.},

The expression pattern of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in primary gastric epithelial cells and cell lines was compared. Primary cells did not express TLR4, whereas all cell lines expressed a nonsignaling form of TLR4. Because other cells within the mucosa expressed TLR4, it was next investigated whether H. pylori can be recognized by TLR4--they cannot. Moreover, H. pylori infection of primary cells induced a regulated production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, whereas infection of cell lines only resulted in IL-8 production. The cytokine production in all cell types was strictly cag dependent. These findings indicate that, although the epithelium is important in directing the immune response against H. pylori infections, the response is independent of TLR4.},

This study was undertaken to establish a safe and effective dose of LT, to confirm the safety of recombinant urease, and to compare the immunogenicity of orally compared with enterically delivered urease. METHODS: 42 healthy adults without present or past H pylori infection were randomised to receive 60 mg recombinant H pylori urease in soluble or in encapsulated form, given with doses of LT ranging from 0 micro g to 2.5 micro g. Four oral doses were administered at day 1, 8, 29, and 57. Specific IgG, IgA, and antibody secreting cells were measured as well as total alpha4beta7 integrin positive lymphocyte responses. RESULTS: Enterically delivered urease was well tolerated and no serious adverse events occurred. Mild diarrhoea (one to four loose stools) occurred after the first immunisation in 50\% (6 of 12) of the volunteers exposed to 2.5 micro g LT (p=0.06; paired t test, compared with baseline) but not in volunteers exposed to lower LT doses. Immune responses occurred in five (p=0.048; Fisher's exact test), one, two, and one of six subjects exposed to 2.5 micro g, 0.5 micro g, 0.1 micro g, and no LT, respectively. Significant CD4(+), CD69(+), and CD45RO(hi) responses occurred over time among alpha4beta7(hi) lymphocytes in volunteers receiving 2.5 micro g LT. Enterically delivered urease induced higher lymphocyte responses than soluble urease. CONCLUSIONS: The safety of H pylori urease is confirmed. Oral LT may conserve its adjuvant activity at low doses with minimal side effects.},

  abstract = {The bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), has evolved to survive in the highly acidic environment of the stomach and colonize on the epithelial surface of the gastric mucosa. Its pathogenic effects are well known to cause gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. In order to infect the stomach and establish colonies on the mucus epithelial surface, the bacterium has to move across the gel-like gastric mucus lining of the stomach under acidic conditions. In this review we address the question of how the bacterium gets past the protective mucus barrier from a biophysical perspective. We begin by reviewing the molecular structure of gastric mucin and discuss the current state of understanding concerning mucin polymerization and low pH induced gelation. We then focus on the viscoelasticity of mucin in view of its relevance to the transport of particles and bacteria across mucus, the key first step in H. pylori infection. The second part of the review focuses on the motility of H. pylori in mucin solutions and gels, and how infection with H. pylori in turn impacts the viscoelastic properties of mucin. We present recent microscopic results tracking the motion of H. pylori in mucin solutions and gels. We then discuss how the biochemical strategy of urea hydrolysis required for survival in the acid is also relevant to the mechanism that enables flagella-driven swimming across the mucus gel layer. Other aspects of the influence of H. pylori infection such as, altering gastric mucin expression, its rate of production and its composition, and the influence of mucin on factors controlling H. pylori virulence and proliferation are briefly discussed with references to relevant literature.},

CD4(+) T cells that express Foxp3 and Tr1-like cells that produce IL-10 comprise the major regulatory populations in the intestine. CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T cells play an important functional role in promoting tolerance of the flora and dietary proteins. Tr1-like cells can be generated in conditions that also promote effector T cell responses and may serve a similar function. In this review, we discuss the signals specific to the gastrointestinal tract that support both regulatory cell types and their distinct modes of action in the mesenteric lymph nodes and intestinal tissues. Dysregulation of intestinal immune homeostasis occurs in inflammatory bowel disease and can also be observed in graft-versus-host disease, tumor immunotherapy regimens, and acute HIV infection.},

During H. pylori infection, class II MHC expression by the gastric epithelium increases, as does the number of local CD4(+) T cells, which appear to be important in the associated pathogenesis. These observations suggested that the epithelium might present antigens to T cells. Thus, we sought to determine whether gastric epithelial cells process antigens to establish their function as local antigen presenting cells (APC). We examined a panel of gastric epithelial cell lines for expression of the antigen processing cathepsins B (CB), L (CL), S (CS), and D (CD). The mRNA for these enzymes were detected by RT-PCR and the enzymes in the gastric epithelial cells were identified by various independent methods. We corroborated the expression of CB and CD on gastric epithelial cells from human biopsy samples. The functions of these proteases were confirmed by assessing their ability to digest ovalbumin, a conventional dietary antigen, and proteins from H. pylori. In summary, multiple lines of evidence suggest gastric epithelial cells process antigens for presentation to CD4(+) T cells. To our knowledge, these are the first studies to document the antigen processing capacity of human gastric epithelial cells.},

In a search for a specific inhibitor of IL-8 expression, we applied tandem affinity purification to investigate interaction of NRF and NFkappaB p65 in cells. We identified a synthetic peptide corresponding to aa 223-238 of NRF interfering with binding of endogenous p65 to NRF. Furthermore, nucleofection experiments were established to introduce this inhibitory peptide into the nucleus of IL-1 stimulated human cervical and Helicobacter pylori infected gastric epithelial cells. Our data clearly show that the specific peptide disturbing NRF/NFkappaB interaction is able to significantly decrease endogenous IL-8 gene transcription in response to IL-1 or Helicobacter pylori infection. Thus, our study provides novel insights into NRF and NFkappaB interaction in vivo and may facilitate the design of new anti-IL-8 drugs based on novel strategies.},

In addition to defining a new arm of the adaptive immune response, studies of the Th17 pathway have led to a greater appreciation of the developmental flexibility, or plasticity, that is a feature of T-cell developmental programs. Since the initial finding that differentiation of Th17 cells is promoted by transforming growth factor-{$\beta$} (TGF{$\beta$}), it became clear that Th17 cell development overlapped that of induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells. Subsequent findings established that Th17 cells are also unusually flexible in their late developmental programming, demonstrating substantial overlap with conventional Th1 cells through mechanisms that are just beginning to be understood but would appear to have important implications for immunoregulation at homeostasis and in immune-mediated diseases. Herein we examine the developmental and functional features of Th17 cells in relation to iTreg cells, Th1 cells, and Th22 cells, as a basis for understanding the contributions of this pathway to host defense, immune homeostasis, and immune-mediated disease.},

T(FH) cells are characterized by their localization to the B cell follicle and their high expression of the costimulatory molecules ICOS and PD1 and the cytokine IL-21, which promotes immunoglobulin (Ig) class switching and production by B cells. We show that the heterodimeric cytokine IL-27 is critical for the function of T(FH) cells and for normal and pathogenic GC responses. IL-27 signaling to T cells results in the production of IL-21, a known autocrine factor for the maintenance of T(FH) cells, in a STAT3-dependent manner. IL-27 also enhances the survival of activated CD4(+) T cells and the expression of T(FH) cell phenotypic markers. In vivo, expression of the IL-27R{$\alpha$} chain is required to support IL-21 production and T(FH) cell survival in a T cell-intrinsic manner. The production of high-affinity antibodies is reduced, and pristane-elicited autoantibodies and glomerulonephritis are significantly diminished, in Il27ra(-/-) mice. Together, our data show a nonredundant role for IL-27 in the development of T cell-dependent antibody responses.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is a major cause of gastroduodenal injury, gastric cancer, and lymphoma, and, thus, there is great interest in its detection and eradication. Several detection methods are available, including histochemical and immunohistochemical stains. Application of these stains in clinical practice is heterogenous, to say the least. Although they were developed to enhance H. pylori detection, changing practice models, financial considerations, and a perceived need for rapid case turnaround have led to their widespread use in routine staining studies ordered reflexively on all gastric biopsies. Emerging data suggest that most of these stains are not needed to establish a diagnosis of H. pylori infection, and their added value when biopsies show minimal, or no, inflammation is not clear. In this manuscript, the Rodger C. Haggitt Gastrointestinal Pathology Society puts forth recommendations regarding ancillary stain usage for H. pylori detection based upon critical literature review and collective experience. Pathologists rarely, if ever, detect H. pylori in "normal" biopsies, but readily observe them in optimally stained hematoxylin and eosin sections from infected patients. Therefore, we suggest that use of ancillary stains is appropriate when biopsies show chronic, or chronic active, gastritis without detectable H. pylori in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, but performing them "up front" on all gastric biopsies is generally unnecessary. Application of these stains to nongastric biopsies and polyps is appropriate in an extremely limited set of circumstances. It is our hope that recommendations provided herein will provide helpful information to gastroenterologists, pathologists, and others involved in the evaluation of patients for possible H. pylori infection.},

Furthermore, the TFSS is involved in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines. While the H. pylori genes required for TFSS function have been investigated systematically, little is known about possible host cell factors involved. We infected 19 different mammalian cell lines individually with H. pylori and analyzed CagA translocation, dephosphorylation of host cell proteins, chemokine secretion (interleukin-8 and macrophage inflammatory protein 2), and changes in cellular phenotypes. Our results demonstrate that not only bacterial but also host cell factors determine the cellular response to infection. The identification of such unknown host cell factors will add to our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and might help in the development of new therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a non-invasive microorganism causing intense gastric mucosal inflammatory and immune reaction. H. pylori-induced gastric mucosal cytokine overproduction has been clearly documented previously. The stomach has a large surface area and continuous spill-over of locally produced cytokines into the blood stream is a possibility. There are few and conflicting data on circulatory proinflammatory cytokine levels in patients with H. pylori infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two dyspeptic patients were enrolled into the study. The presence of H. pylori infection was diagnosed with antral histopathologic examination. After overnight fasting; serum samples were obtained from each patient to determine circulating interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. RESULTS: H. pylori was shown in 30 cases using Giemsa stain in antral histopathologic evaluation. Twelve cases were negative for H. pylori staining. Both the age and sex distribution had an insignificant difference in both H pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative groups. The mean circulatory levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-a in both groups were not different. The situation was same in respect to the serum levels of these cytokines and the degree of inflammation, H. pylori density and activation scores according to Sydney classification. CONCLUSION: We could not show elevated circulatory levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha in H. pylori-infected cases. We believe that H. pylori-related cytokine activation become concentrated on gastric mucosa and this pathogen-induced local inflammatory cascade does not cause changes in circulatory levels of these cytokines. Moreover, there is no correlation between the levels of serum cytokines and Sydney parameters.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Helicobacter pylori is the main risk factor for the development of non-cardia gastric cancer. Increased proliferation of the gastric mucosa is a feature of H. pylori infection. Mucosal interkeukin-1beta production is increased in H. pylori infection and IL-1beta genotypes associated with increased pro-inflammatory activity are risk factors for the development of gastric cancer. The effect of IL-1beta on gastric epithelial cell proliferation has been examined in this study. METHODS AGS cells were cultured with IL-1beta. DNA synthesis was assed by [3H]thymidine incorporation and total viable cell numbers by MTT assay. RESULTS IL-1beta dose dependently increased DNA synthesis and cell numbers. The enhanced proliferation was blocked by interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Addition of neutralising antibody to GM-CSF reduced IL-1beta-stimulated proliferation by 31 +/- 4 \%. GM-CSF alone significantly stimulated proliferation. Addition or neutralisation of IL-8 had no effect on basal or IL-1beta-stimulated proliferation. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein completely blocked IL-1beta-stimulated proliferation and inhibition of the extracellular signal related kinase pathway with PD 98059 inhibited IL-1beta stimulated proliferation by 58 +/- 5 \%. CONCLUSIONS IL-1beta stimulates proliferation in gastric epithelial cells. Autocrine stimulation by GM-CSF contributes to this proliferative response. Signalling via tyrosine kinase activity is essential to the mitogenic response to IL-1beta. The extracellular signal related kinase pathway is involved in, but not essential to downstream signalling. IL-1beta may contribute to the hyperproliferation seen in H. pylori- infected gastric mucosa, and be involved in the carcinogenic process.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is recognised as the chief cause of chronic gastritis, ulcers and gastric cancer in humans. With increased incidence of treatment failure and antibiotic resistance, development of prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination is a desirable alternative. Although the results of vaccination studies in animal models have been promising, studies in human volunteers have revealed problems such as 'post-immunisation gastritis' and comparatively poor responses to vaccine antigens. The focus of this study was to compare the gastric and systemic cellular immune responses induced by recombinant attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium-based vaccination in the C57BL/6 model of H. pylori infection. Analysis of lymphocyte populations in the gastric mucosa, blood, spleen, paragastric LN and MLN revealed that the effects of vaccination were largely confined to the parenchymal stomach rather than lymphoid organs. Vaccine-induced protection was correlated with an augmented local recall response in the gastric mucosa, with increased proportions of CD4(+) T cells, neutrophils and reduced proportions of CD4(+) Treg. CD4(+) T cells isolated from the stomachs of vaccinated mice proliferated ex vivo in response to H. pylori antigen, and secreted Th1 cytokines, particularly IFN-{$\gamma$}. This detailed analysis of local gastric immune responses provides insight into the mechanism of vaccine-induced protection.},

Little is known, however, about the transcriptional regulation of the p40 gene in vivo. In an attempt toward this goal, we have generated transgenic mice expressing firefly luciferase under the control of the IL-12 p40 promoter. High constitutive transgene expression was found in the small intestine only, whereas little reporter gene activity was observed in other tissues. Within the small bowel, constitutive promoter activity was restricted to the terminal ileum and associated with high expression of p40 mRNA as well as p40 and IL-23 p19/p40 proteins. The cells constitutively producing IL-12 p40 were identified as CD8alpha and CD11b double-negative CD11c+ lamina propria dendritic cells (LPDCs) that represent a major cell population in the lamina propria of the small intestine, but not in the colon. FISH directly demonstrated the uptake of bacteria by a subset of LPDCs in the terminal ileum that was associated with p40 expression. Furthermore, little or no p40 protein expression in LPDCs was found in the terminal ileum of germfree mice, indicating a key role of the intestinal flora for constitutive p40 expression. In addition, analysis of transgenic mice with a mutated NF-kappaB target site in the p40 promoter showed a critical role of NF-kappaB for constitutive transgene expression. Our data reveal important functional differences between the mucosal immune systems of the small and large bowel in healthy mice and suggest that the high bacterial load in the terminal ileum activates p40 gene transcription in LPDCs through NF-kappaB. These data suggest a predisposition of the terminal ileum to develop chronic inflammatory responses through IL-23 and thus may provide a molecular explanation for the preferential clinical manifestation of Crohn disease in this part of the gut.},

Subsequent studies revealed that dendritic cells from p19-deficient mice produce elevated levels of IL-12, and that IL-23 down-regulates IL-12 expression upon TLR ligation. Finally, in vivo blockade of IL-12 p40 in IL-23-deficient mice rescued mice from lethal colitis.

Here we investigated whether mouse Th17 cells with specificity for an islet antigen can induce diabetes upon transfer into NOD/SCID recipient mice. Induction of diabetes in NOD/SCID mice via adoptive transfer of Th1 cells from BDC2.5 transgenic mice was prevented by treatment of the recipient mice with a neutralizing IFN-{$\gamma$}-specific antibody. This result suggested a major role of Th1 cells in the induction of disease in this model of type 1 diabetes. Nevertheless, transfer of highly purified Th17 cells from BDC2.5 transgenic mice caused diabetes in NOD/SCID recipients with similar rates of onset as in transfer of Th1 cells. However, treatment with neutralizing IL-17-specific antibodies did not prevent disease. Instead, the transferred Th17 cells, completely devoid of IFN-{$\gamma$} at the time of transfer, rapidly converted to secrete IFN-{$\gamma$} in the NOD/SCID recipients. Purified Th17 cells also upregulated Tbet and secreted IFN-{$\gamma$} upon exposure to IL-12 in vitro and in vivo in NOD/SCID recipients. These results indicate substantial plasticity of Th17 commitment toward a Th1-like profile.},

Development of chimeric, "humanized" and human mAbs broadened therapeutic application to immune-mediated diseases requiring long-term treatment. Indeed, mAb therapeutics targeting soluble cytokines are highly effective in numerous immune-mediated disorders. A recent example is ustekinumab, a first-in-class therapeutic human immunoglobulin G1 kappa mAb that binds to the interleukins (IL)-12 and IL-23, cytokines that modulate lymphocyte function, including T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell subsets. Ustekinumab was generated via recombinant human IL-12 immunization of human immunoglobulin (hu-Ig) transgenic mice. Ustekinumab binds to the p40 subunit common to IL-12 and IL-23 and prevents their interaction with the IL-12 receptor {$\beta$}1 subunit of the IL-12 and IL-23 receptor complexes. Ustekinumab is approved for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and has demonstrated efficacy in Crohn disease and psoriatic arthritis. The clinical characterization of ustekinumab continues to clarify our understanding of human immune pathologies and may offer a novel therapeutic option for certain immune-mediated diseases.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori, in recent years, has been recognized as the major causative agent in chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease in humans. H. pylori is a ubiquitous organism, with at least half of the world's population infected. Of those individuals with peptic ulcer disease, it is estimated that 90\% of cases are caused by H. pylori. Currently, the efficacy of therapies is starting to decline due to increasing resistance rates, especially towards clarithromycin. Due to this, new therapies are needed to combat this bacterium. It is hypothesized that cytokine release (especially interleukin-1beta, -6, -8, and TNF-alpha) due to H. pylori infection and the subsequent influx of inflammatory cells causes a massive release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the inflammatory reaction. The ROS then cause the pathologic changes seen in the infected tissues. In this study, human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line ATCC 1739 (a cell line not previously evaluated) was examined for its production of interleukin-1beta, -6, -8, and TNF-alpha when cocultured in a ratio of 10:1 H. pylori to adenocarcinoma cells, to determine its value as a model to demonstrate the inflammatory response. Results from this study indicated that ATCC 1739 cells only reliably produced IL-8 when cocultured with H. pylori and stimulated with TNF-alpha. The production of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha by the ATCC 1739 cells was no different in H. pylori-exposed cells than non-exposed cells. It was concluded that the ATCC 1739 cell line is not suitable to study the effects of coculture with H. pylori on cytokine production.},

Mucins are the main components of mucus, which is secreted by goblet cells and forms a protective homeostatic barrier between the resident microbiota and the underlying immune cells in the colon. However, the specific role of mucin-type O-glycans in mucus barrier function has been uncertain. Recent studies utilizing mice deficient in key glycosyltransferases involved in O-glycan biosynthesis on intestinal mucins have underscored the importance of mucin-type O-glycosylation in mucus barrier function. This review will highlight recent advances in our understanding of mucin-type O-glycan function in the mucus barrier and how they promote mutualism with our resident microbiota.},

  abstract = {On activation, T cells undergo distinct developmental pathways, attaining specialized properties and effector functions. T-helper (TH) cells are traditionally thought to differentiate into TH1 and TH2 cell subsets. TH1 cells are necessary to clear intracellular pathogens and TH2 cells are important for clearing extracellular organisms. Recently, a subset of interleukin (IL)-17-producing T (TH17) cells distinct from TH1 or TH2 cells has been described and shown to have a crucial role in the induction of autoimmune tissue injury. In contrast, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells inhibit autoimmunity and protect against tissue injury. Transforming growth factor-{$\beta$} (TGF-{$\beta$}) is a critical differentiation factor for the generation of Treg cells. Here we show, using mice with a reporter introduced into the endogenous Foxp3 locus, that IL-6, an acute phase protein induced during inflammation, completely inhibits the generation of Foxp3+ Treg cells induced by TGF-{$\beta$}. We also demonstrate that IL-23 is not the differentiation factor for the generation of TH17 cells. Instead, IL-6 and TGF-{$\beta$} together induce the differentiation of pathogenic TH17 cells from naive T cells. Our data demonstrate a dichotomy in the generation of pathogenic (TH17) T cells that induce autoimmunity and regulatory (Foxp3+) T cells that inhibit autoimmune tissue injury.},

Along the hydrophilic heterodimeric interface, fewer charged residues are involved for IL-23 compared with IL-12.

Human gastric tissue has been the least investigated for stability of reference gene expression. In this study, three popular algorithms, GeNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper were used to evaluate the reference gene stability. Conclusion: HPRT1 and GAPDH are the best performing pair of reference genes for qRT-PCR profiling experiments involving non-malignant gastric tissue samples.},

Comprehensive genome characterization of H. pylori populations from different human host backgrounds including healthy individuals provides the exciting potential to generate new insights into the open question whether human health outcome is associated with specific H. pylori genotypes or dependent on other environmental factors. We report the genome sequences of 65 H. pylori isolates from individuals with gastric cancer, preneoplastic lesions, peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, and from asymptomatic adults. Isolates were collected from multiple locations in North America (USA and Canada) as well as from Columbia and Japan. The availability of these H. pylori genome sequences from individuals with distinct clinical presentations provides the research community with a resource for detailed investigations into genetic elements that correlate either positively or negatively with the epidemiology, human host adaptation, and gastric pathogenesis and will aid in the characterization of strains that may favor the development of specific pathology, including gastric cancer.},

These cytokines induce the secretion of chemokines and antimicrobial proteins, thereby orchestrating the mucosal barrier against gastrointestinal pathogens. While the mucosal barrier prevents bacterial dissemination from the gut, it also promotes colonization by pathogens that are resistant to some of the inducible antimicrobial responses.

With modern life, for probably the first time in human history, there are large numbers of noncolonized persons. Duodenal ulceration has been present essentially for only 200 years; that its incidence rose just as H. pylori was waning is best explained by changes in gastric microecology. As H. pylori is disappearing, duodenal ulceration and gastric cancer rates are falling. However, more proximal diseases, gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), Barrett's esophagus, and adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia and lower esophagus, are increasing; colonization with cag+ H. pylori strains appears protective against these diseases. Thus, in the 21st century, the continuing decline in H. pylori may lead to the disappearance of duodenal ulcers and distal gastric cancers and toward a marked increase in GERD, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma.},

We sought to determine whether neutrophils responding to in vivo infection with the protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii were capable of IL-12 production as suggested by recent in vitro studies. Intraperitoneal infection induced a neutrophil influx by 4 h, accompanied by ex vivo IL-12 p40 and p70 release. Approximately 85\% of the neutrophils displayed intracellular stores of IL-12, as determined by flow cytometry and confocal fluorescence microscopy. Neutrophils from IFN-gamma knockout mice also expressed IL-12, ruling out an IFN-gamma-priming requirement. Neither infected nor uninfected peritoneal macrophages displayed intracellular IL-12, but these cells were strongly IL-10(+). Infection per se was unnecessary for IL-12 production because peritoneal and peripheral blood neutrophils from uninfected animals contained IL-12(+) populations. Expression of the granulocyte maturation marker Gr-1 (Ly-6G) was correlated with IL-12 production. Mice depleted of their granulocytes by mAb administration at the time of infection had decreased serum levels of IL-12 p40. These results suggest a model in which neutrophils with prestored IL-12 are rapidly mobilized to an infection site where they are triggered by the parasite to release cytokine. Our findings place neutrophils prominently in the cascade of early events leading to IL-12-dependent immunity to T. gondii.},

The mucosal immune response to H.~pylori is first initiated by the activation of gastric epithelial cells that respond to numerous bacterial factors, such as the cytotoxin-associated gene A or the lipopolysaccharide intermediate heptose-1,7-bisphosphate. The response of these cells is orchestrated by different receptors including the intracellular nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 or the extracellular epidermal growth factor receptor. This nonspecific response leads to recruitment and activation of various myeloid (macrophages and dendritic cells) and T cells (T helper-17 and mucosal-associated invariant T cells), which magnify and maintain inflammation. In this review, we summarize the major advances made in the past year regarding the induction, the regulation, and the role of the innate and adaptive immune responses to H.~pylori infection. We also recapitulate efforts that have been made to develop efficient vaccine strategies.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative spiral-shaped bacterium, member of epsilon-Proteobacteria specifically colonizing the gastric epithelium of humans. It causes one of the most common infections worldwide, affecting about half of the world's population. However, it should be noted that the prevalence of H. pylori, particularly in the Western world, has significantly decreased coinciding with an increase of some autoimmune and allergic diseases, such as asthma. Various epidemiological studies have also documented a negative association between H. pylori colonization and the presence of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and risk of esophageal cancer. Additionally, an upward trend of obesity recently observed in inhabitants of developed countries raised a question about the relationship between H. pylori infection and the human body mass index. The first part of this review describes common, recommended anti-H. pylori treatments. The second part, presents the results of recent experiments aimed at evaluating the association between H. pylori infections and gastro-esophageal diseases, the level of stomach hormones, the human body mass index and allergic diseases. Although some studies suggest an inverse association of H. pylori infection with some health problems of the modern world such as asthma, obesity or GERD, H. pylori should be considered as a harmful human pathogen responsible for serious and sometimes lethal diseases. Thus, many scientists advocate the eradication of H. pylori.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an 18 kDa peptide with a range of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. AIM: To determine whether this cytokine is involved in gastric mucosal inflammation in Helicobacter pylori infection. METHODS: The production of IL-10 by antral mucosal biopsy specimens during short term in vitro culture was determined by measuring IL-10 content of supernatants by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). H pylori status was determined by serology and histology, with gastritis scored using the Sydney system. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) content of supernatants was also determined in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: IL-10 secretion was significantly greater in patients with H pylori associated chronic gastritis than in patients who were H pylori negative with normal mucosa/reactive changes, and those with H pylori negative chronic gastritis (p {$<$} 0.01 and {$<$} 0.05 respectively). There was a significant correlation overall between IL-10 secretion and chronic inflammation score (r = 0.40). Secretion of TNF-alpha, which was significantly higher in H pylori infected patients than uninfected patients with a normal mucosa (p {$<$} 0.04), correlated with scores for chronic inflammation and activity (r = 0.39 and 0.38 respectively), but was only weakly correlated with IL-10 secretion (r = 0.22, NS). CONCLUSIONS: Gastric mucosal production of IL-10 and TNF-alpha are increased in chronic gastritis associated with H pylori infection, and mucosal cytokine secretion varies with important histopathological aspects of gastric inflammation. Whereas the secretion of IL-10 in H pylori infection may be protective, limiting tissue damage caused by inflammation, it may also contribute towards failure of the immune response to eliminate the organism.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a counter-inflammatory peptide implicated in the downregulation of human intestinal immune responses. Enhanced secretion of IL-10 has been documented in gastric biopsy organ culture in Helicobacter pylori infection. This study aimed to define the cellular origins of IL-10 in H pylori associated gastritis, and to determine the effects of endogenous IL-10 on proinflammatory cytokine secretion in vitro. METHODS: Endoscopic biopsies were obtained from the gastric antrum at endoscopy from patients with dyspepsia. Two pairs of antral biopsies were cultured in vitro for 24 hours, one pair in the presence of neutralising anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody, the other pair as controls. The cytokine content of culture supernatants (tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6, and IL-8) was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and corrected for biopsy weight. Helicobacter pylori status was established by histology and biopsy urease test, and histopathology graded by the Sydney system. In a subgroup of patients, western blotting was used to establish CagA serological status. Immunohistochemistry for IL-10 was performed on formalin fixed tissues using a combination of microwave antigen retrieval and the indirect avidin-biotin technique. Immunoreactivity was scored semiquantitatively. RESULTS: In vitro culture was performed in 41 patients: 31 with H pylori positive chronic gastritis and 10 H pylori negative. In vitro secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 for "control" biopsies was significantly higher in H pylori positive versus negative samples, with values of TNF-alpha and IL-6 correlating with the degree of active and chronic inflammation and being higher in CagA seropositive cases. No evidence for enhanced cytokine secretion was seen in biopsies cocultured in the presence of anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 29 patients, of whom 13 were H pylori positive. IL-10 immunoreactivity was observed in the surface epithelium in all H pylori positive cases and in 13 of 16 negative cases, especially in areas of surface epithelial degeneration. Lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMNCs) were positively stained in all H pylori positive cases and in 12 of 16 negative cases, with a significantly greater proportion of positive LPMNCs in the positive group. CONCLUSIONS: This study localised IL-10 protein to the gastric epithelium and LPMNCs. In vitro proinflammatory cytokine secretion was increased in H pylori infection (especially CagA positive infection), but blocking endogenous IL-10 secretion did not significantly increase cytokine secretion. IL-10 is implicated in H pylori infection and might "damp down" local inflammation. The role of gastric IL-10 secretion in determining the clinicopathological outcome of infection merits further study.},

Nevertheless, current methods to detect Helicobacteraceae in the human gut have significant limitations. METHODS Based on 16S-rRNA gene alignments and computer aided primer analysis a set of group-specific PCR primers was designed. The evaluation of the PCR assay was performed using 36 ATCC reference strains and intestinal biopsies from 10 patients with defined gastric Helicobacter pylori status. The amplification products derived from clinical samples were cloned and subsequently analyzed by DNA sequencing. Sensitivity of the PCR-assay was determined by spiking previously negative tested samples with decreasing amounts of Helicobacter DNA. RESULTS The analysis of the ATCC reference strains revealed amplification products in all 14 Helicobacter strains and Wolinella succinogenes, 21 other microorganisms representing negative controls did not produce PCR fragments. Four out of the 10 patient-derived samples were positive. Three of them represented H. pylori-derived DNA confirming the gastric H. pylori infection in these patients. In the fourth patient, who was suffering from Crohn's disease, H. pullorum was identified. The sensitivity of the PCR assay was 0.1 pg of Helicobacter-derived DNA representing about 40 bacteria. CONCLUSION The novel PCR assay described here is an important new tool in rapid and sensitive assessment for the presence of Helicobacteraceae in human gut.},

However, there is little information about the prevalence of EHS in noncommercial animal facilities. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and the spread of EHS in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice. Fecal samples of 40 mouse lines were analyzed for members of the family Helicobacteraceae using a group-specific PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Additional experiments were carried out to evaluate the spread of EHS among mice harbored in different caging systems. Helicobacter species were detected in 87.5\% of the mouse lines tested. Five different Helicobacter species were identified: H. ganmani, H. hepaticus, H. typhlonicus, and the putative Helicobacter species represented by the isolates hamster B and MIT 98-5357. Helicobacter infection did not spread between animals in neighboring cages when individually ventilated cages were used; in contrast, when the mice were reared in open-air cages, EHS were found to spread from cage to cage. However, the spread was prevented by adding polycarbonate filter tops to the cages. When Helicobacter-negative and infected mice shared the same cage, transmission of the infection occurred in 100\% within 2 weeks. Furthermore, we found that mice from commercial breeding facilities may carry undetected Helicobacter infections. Taken together, we show that infection with EHS may frequently occur and spread easily in mice reared under SPF conditions despite extensive safety precautions. Moreover, there is a high prevalence of rather uncommon Helicobacter species that may be a consequence of the current routine procedures used for health screening of SPF mice.},

  abstract = {Prostaglandins, particularly prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), play an important role during inflammation. This is exemplified by the clinical use of cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, which interfere with PGE2 synthesis, as effective antiinflammatory drugs. Here, we show that PGE2 directly promotes differentiation and proinflammatory functions of human and murine IL-17\textendash producing T helper (Th17) cells. In human purified naive T cells, PGE2 acts via prostaglandin receptor EP2- and EP4-mediated signaling and cyclic AMP pathways to up-regulate IL-23 and IL-1 receptor expression. Furthermore, PGE2 synergizes with IL-1{$\beta$} and IL-23 to drive retinoic acid receptor\textendash related orphan receptor (ROR)-{$\gamma$}t, IL-17, IL-17F, CCL20, and CCR6 expression, which is consistent with the reported Th17 phenotype. While enhancing Th17 cytokine expression mainly through EP2, PGE2 differentially regulates interferon (IFN)-{$\gamma$} production and inhibits production of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 in Th17 cells predominantly through EP4. Furthermore, PGE2 is required for IL-17 production in the presence of antigen-presenting cells. Hence, the combination of inflammatory cytokines and noncytokine immunomodulators, such as PGE2, during differentiation and activation determines the ultimate phenotype of Th17 cells. These findings, together with the altered IL-12/IL-23 balance induced by PGE2 in dendritic cells, further highlight the crucial role of the inflammatory microenvironment in Th17 cell development and regulation.},

For intestinal-type gastric cancer, a multistep process of mucosal alterations leading from gastritis via glandular atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia to invasive carcinoma is well recognized. Ongoing clinical studies focus on a 'point of no return'. It is defined as a situation when certain alterations are no longer reversible by H. pylori eradication and progression to gastric cancer may continue. H. pylori affects the mucosal as well as the systemic immune response by secretion of cytokines and the recruitment of distinct inflammatory cells. The immune response is characterized by a balance between a Th1-dominated response and the recruitment of antigen-specific regulatory T cells that allow the bacteria to persist in human gastric mucosa. Besides immune-mediated effects, H. pylori induces cellular alterations as well as genetic alterations in genes that are essential for the epigenetic integrity and mucosal homeostasis. These genetic alterations during gastric cancer development are in focus of intensive research and should ultimately allow the identification of risk factors involved in gastric carcinogenesis. The detection of individuals at high risk for gastric cancer would help to design appropriate strategies for prevention and surveillance.},

Some modifications in the chemotherapies used for palliation and strategies for downstaging of the disease prior to surgical intervention are noteworthy. The positive experience with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and submucosal dissection (ESD) for treatment of early gastric cancer has been confirmed and extended. The procedure-related morbidity and post-interventional quality of life is clearly favorable compared to open surgical resection in well-selected patients. New data on Helicobacter pylori revealed that eradication after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer significantly reduces the incidence of recurrent and metachronous gastric neoplasias. It can further improve healing rates of treatment induced gastric ulcers. Eradication therapy therefore remains the best target for prevention of the disease. Critical is the "point of no return" when mucosal alterations (i.e. intestinal metaplasia, glandular atrophy) are no longer reversible. A population-based screen-and-eradicate strategy for H. pylori infection can at present only be recommended in high incidence regions.},

Serological testing with the detection of pepsinogen 1 (PG1), pepsinogen 2 (PG2) and gastrin 17 (G17) offers the possibility to detect preneoplastic gastric mucosal conditions. Aim of this study was to assess the performance of these serological tests in the presence of gastric neoplasia. METHODS: Histological and serological samples of 118 patients with gastric cancer have been assessed for tumor specific characteristics (Laur\'en type, localisation), degree of mucosal abnormalities (intestinal metaplasia, atrophy) and serological parameters (PG1, PG2, PG1/2-ratio, G17, H. pylori IgG, CagA status). Association of the general factors to the different serological values have been statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with intestinal type gastric cancer had lower PG1 levels and a lower PG1/2-ratio compared to those with diffuse type cancer (p = 0.003). The serum levels of PG2 itself and G17 were not significantly altered. H. pylori infection in general had no influence on the levels of PG1, PG2 and G17 in the serum of gastric cancer patients. There was a trend towards lower PG1 levels in case of positive CagA-status (p = 0.058). The degree of both intestinal metaplasia and atrophy correlated inversely with serum levels for PG1 and the PG1/2-ratio (p {$<$} 0.01). Laur\'en-specific analysis revealed that this is only true for intestinal type tumors. Univariate ANOVA revealed atrophy and CagA-status as the only independent factors for low PG1 and a low PG1/2-ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Glandular atrophy and a positive CagA status are determinant factors for decreased pepsinogen 1 levels in the serum of patients with gastric cancer. The serological assessment of gastric atrophy by analysis of serum pepsinogen is only adequate for patients with intestinal type cancer.},

IL-27(p28/EBI3) is an emerging key player essential for regulating inflammatory responses and T cells. In this article, we report that C5a robustly suppressed IL-27(p28) gene expression and release in peritoneal macrophages. These cells from C57BL/6J mice abundantly produced IL-27(p28) after engagement of either the TLR3 (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid) or TLR4 (LPS) receptor. Genetic deficiency of either TLR4 or LBP completely incapacitated the ability of macrophages to secrete IL-27(p28) in response to LPS. IL-27(p28)-producing macrophages also expressed the C5aR receptor, thus displaying an IL-27(p28)(+)F4/80(+)C5aR(+) phenotype. C5a suppressed IL-27(p28) in LPS-stimulated macrophages via interactions with the C5aR receptor rather than the C5L2 receptor. After endotoxemia, C5aR(-/-) mice displayed higher plasma levels of IL-27(p28) compared with C57BL/6J mice. C5a did not affect the release of IL-27(p28) or the frequency of IL-27(p28)(+)F4/80(+) macrophages after engagement of TLR3. Mechanistically, LPS activated both the NF-{$\kappa$}B and the PI3K/Akt pathways, whereas C5a activated only the PI3K/Akt pathway. Engagement of PI3K/Akt was inhibitory for IL-27(p28) production, because PI3K/Akt pharmacologic blockade resulted in increased amounts of IL-27(p28) and reversed the suppressive effects of C5a. Blockade of PI3K/Akt in endotoxemic C57BL/6J mice resulted in higher generation of IL-27(p28). In contrast, the PI3K/Akt pathway was not involved in TLR3-mediated release of IL-27(p28). These data provide new evidence about how complement activation may selectively interfere with production of T cell regulatory cytokines by APCs in the varying contexts of either bacterial (TLR4 pathway) or viral (TLR3 pathway) infection.},

IL-27 is composed of two subunits (p28 and EBI3) and is classified as a member of the IL-12 family of cytokines. APCs have been recognized as a major cellular source of IL-27 following activation with microbial products or IFNs (types I and II). In this review, we describe the current knowledge of the implications of IL-27 during the pathogenesis of infectious and autoimmune diseases. Experimental studies have used genetically targeted IL-27RA-/- mice, EBI3-/- mice, and p28-/- mice or involved study designs with administration of bioengineered IL-27/IL-27RA homologs. Whereas many reports have described that IL-27 suppresses inflammation, we also review the current literature, suggesting promotion of inflammation by IL-27 in some settings. Recent advances have also been made in understanding the cross-talk of cleavage products of the complement system with IL-27-mediated immune responses. Additional data on IL-27 have been obtained recently by observational studies in human patients with acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Collectively, the findings from the past decade identify IL-27 as a critical immunoregulatory cytokine, especially for T cells, whereas some controversy is fueled by results challenging the view of IL-27 as a classical silencer of inflammation.},

Here, we show that human na\"ive cord blood expresses a functional IL-27 receptor, consisting of the TCCR and gp130 subunits, although at lower levels as compared to na\"ive and memory splenic B cells. IL-27 does not induce proliferative responses and does not increase IgG1 production by CD19(+)CD27(+) memory B cells. However, it induces a low, but significant production of IgG1 by na\"ive CD19(+)CD27(-)IgD(+)IgG(-) spleen and cord blood B cells, activated via CD40, whereas it has no effect on the production of the other IgG subclasses. In addition, IL-27 induces the differentiation of a population of B cells that express high levels of CD38, in association with a down-regulation of surface IgD expression, and that are surface IgG(+/int), CD20(low), CD27(high), indicating that IL-27 promotes isotype switching and plasma cell differentiation of naive B cells. However, as compared to the effects of IL-21 and IL-10, both switch factors for human IgG1 and IgG3, those of IL-27 are modest and regulate exclusively the production of IgG1. Finally, although IL-27 has no effect on IL-4 and anti-CD40-induced Cepsilon germline promoter activity, it up-regulates IL-4-induced IgE production by naive B cells. These results point to a partial redundancy of switch factors regulating the production of IgG1 in humans, and furthermore indicate the existence of a common regulation of the human IgG1and murine IgG2a isotypes by IL-27.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Interleukin (IL)23, composed of a p19 and a p40 subunit, is suggested to play key roles in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), dependent on the promotion and proliferation of IL17-producing T helper (Th)17 cells. However, previous studies on IL23 expression in human tissues were based on the p19 subunit only. We aimed to study the expression and regulation of IL23 subunits p19 and p40 in RA compared to patients with osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS The expression of p19 and p40 in synovial tissues was analysed by in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. IL23 in RA and OA synovial fluids and sera was determined by ELISA. Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent induction of p19, p40 and bioactive IL23 was determined in RA synovial fibroblasts (RASF), monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) by real-time PCR and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, Western blot and functional assays. RESULTS The p19 subunit was abundantly expressed in RA but not in OA synovial tissues. p19 was most prominently expressed by RASF in the synovial lining layer and at the site of invasion, but no heterodimeric IL23 was detected at these sites. Correspondingly, soluble IL23 was not detectable or found at very low levels in synovial fluids and sera of patients with RA. By in vitro experiments, we confirmed that TLR-activated RASF expressed p19 but not p40, in contrast to monocytes, which produced IL23 following TLR stimulation. CONCLUSION The TLR-dependent induction of p19 but not p40 in RASF and the abundant expression of p19 along with the low or undetectable levels of IL23 in patients with RA provides strong evidence that p19 does not necessarily indicate the presence of IL23, as has been proposed to date.},

In this article, we demonstrate that LT acts as a highly effective adjuvant when administered parenterally, promoting Ag-specific IL-17, as well as IFN-{$\gamma$}, IL-4, and IL-10 production in response to coadministered Ags. We found that the adjuvant activity of LT was mediated in part by inducing dendritic cell (DC) activation; LT promoted CD80 and CD86 expression by DCs and enhanced IL-1{$\alpha$}, IL-1{$\beta$}, and IL-23 production. An LT mutant, LTK63, that lacks enzyme activity was less effective than the wild-type toxin in promoting DC maturation and the development of Ag-specific Th17 cells. LT enhanced IL-23 and IL-1{$\alpha$} production from DCs via activation of ERK MAPK and IL-1{$\beta$} secretion through activation of caspase-1 and the NLRP3 inflammasome. These cytokines played a major role in promoting Th17 responses by LT and LTK63. The induction of Th17 cells in vivo in response to LT and LTK63 as adjuvants was significantly reduced in IL-1RI-deficient mice. Finally, using a murine respiratory infection model, we demonstrated that LT can act as a highly effective adjuvant for a pertussis vaccine, promoting Ag-specific Th17 cells and protection against Bordetella pertussis challenge, which was significantly reduced in IL-17-defective mice. Our findings provide clear evidence that LT can promote protective immune responses in part through induction of innate IL-1 and, consequently, Th17 cells.},

Chain pairing promiscuity is a feature of the IL-12 family. Recently, based on murine data, a new family member, IL-39, was proposed, consisting of IL23p19 (shared with IL-23) and EBI3 (shared with IL-27 and IL-35). IL-39 has subsequently been implicated in experimental murine lupus. Given the success of IL-23p19 therapeutic targeting in diseases including psoriasis, it is of great interest to confirm the presence of IL-39 in man. Human IL-39 is yet to be either detected or expressed, which has halted research in this area. METHODS: Using a disulphide-linked human chimera protein composing of IL-23p19 and EBI3 human chains, we stimulated human leukocytes, and analysed cytokine secretion and STAT3 phosphorylation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We report that this cytokine shows no activity in human cells. IL-39 chimera protein failed to induce either IL-6, IL-8, TNF, or IL-17A from leukocytes or STAT3 phosphorylation and thus, remains a 'theoretical cytokine' in humans.},

After Tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE, separated proteins were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes in a semidry discontinuous buffer system, visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue, excised, digested with trypsin or lysC in 80\% acetonitrile, and then analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. This method has several advantages over in-gel digestion in terms of sample handling, sensitivity, and time. We identified 105 fmol of Bacillus subtilis SecA and 100 approximately 500 fmol of standard proteins. We also analyzed the submembrane protein fraction solubilized by 1\% n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside from B. subtilis membranes after separation by 2-D PAGE, and identified 116 protein spots. This method can detect proteins at the 10 approximately 50 fmol level by pooling more than ten identical electroblotted protein spots.},

One technology that has helped to shed light on this complex signaling network is the cytokine antibody array, which facilitates simultaneous screening of dozens to hundreds of secreted signal proteins in complex biological samples. The combined applications of traditional methods of molecular and cell biology with the high-content, high-throughput screening capabilities of cytokine antibody arrays and other multiplexed immunoassays have revealed a complex mechanism that involves multiple cytokine signals contributed not just by tumor cells but by stromal cells and a wide spectrum of immune cell types. This review will summarize the interactions among cancerous and immune cell types, as well as the key cytokine signals that are required for tumors to survive immunoediting in a dormant state or to grow and spread by escaping it. Additionally, it will present examples of how probing secreted cell-cell signal networks in the tumor microenvironment (TME) with cytokine screens have contributed to our current understanding of these processes and discuss the implications of this understanding to antitumor therapies.},

Although RT efficiency is known to be variable, little attention has been paid to the practical implications of that variability. METHODS: We investigated the reproducibility of the RT step with commercial reverse transcriptases and RNA samples of variable quality and concentration. We quantified several mRNA targets with either singleplex SYBR Green I or dualplex probe-based reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), with the latter used to calculate the correlation between quantification cycles (Cqs) of mRNA targets amplified in the same real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. RESULTS: RT efficiency is enzyme, sample, RNA concentration, and assay dependent and can lead to variable correlation between mRNAs from the same sample. This translates into relative mRNA expression levels that generally vary between 2- and 3-fold, although higher levels are also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the variability of the RT step is sufficiently large to call into question the validity of many published data that rely on quantification of cDNA. Variability can be minimized by choosing an appropriate RTase and high concentrations of RNA and characterizing the variability of individual assays by use of multiple RT replicates.},

Instead of being destroyed in the phagolysosome, the bacterium escapes the phagosome and replicates within the host cytosol. Recent studies indicate that phagosomal escape may have a major impact on the nature of the inflammatory cytokine response to infection. To better understand the host cell response to Francisella infection, we exposed human peripheral blood monocytes to Francisella novicida and analyzed transcriptional changes using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. Results showed a nearly 300-fold up-regulation of transcripts for the p19 subunit of IL-23, and a nearly 18-fold up-regulation for the p40 subunit of IL-12. IL-23 is formed by the heterodimerization of p19 and p40, and is an important cytokine of the innate immune response. Up-regulation of p19 and p40 was confirmed at the protein level by Western blotting and ELISA analyses, and was found to be largely dependent on PI3K and NF-{$\kappa$}B activity. Studies using medium from infected monocytes with or without a p19 blocking Ab showed that the secreted IL-23 induced IFN-{$\gamma$} production from NK cells, suggesting a potential biologically important role for IL-23 in host defense. Finally, infection of human monocytes by the highly virulent Francisella SCHU S4 strain likewise led to IL-23 production, suggesting that the IL-23 response may be relevant during tularemia.},

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of H. pylori infection on mucin gene expression (MUC6, MUC5, and MUC1) in the gastric epithelium. METHODS: Gastric biopsy specimens were examined by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization for mucin gene expression. RESULTS: MUC6 was limited to mucous glands of H. pylori-negative patients, but 72\% of H. pylori-positive patients also expressed MUC6 in surface mucous cells. In contrast, MUC5 mucin was found in significantly fewer surface mucous cells of H. pylori-positive specimens. Carbohydrates recognized by Lewis (Le) X and paradoxical concanavalin A (con A) staining were aberrantly expressed in the surface mucous cells of 16 of 27 and 17 of 23 H. pylori-positive tissues, respectively. Surface Le(b) was present in 26 of 27 H. pylori-positive and 19 of 30 H. pylori-negative tissues. Eradication of H. pylori resulted in reversal of surface MUC5 and MUC6 expression toward normal patterns. Purified gastric mucins of H. pylori-positive patients bound more anti-MUC6 and anti-Le(b) than mucins from H. pylori-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: The type of mucin that is normally limited to mucous glands is aberrantly expressed in surface mucous cells of H. pylori-positive patients, whereas less of the surface epithelium expresses normal surface-type gastric mucin.},

Our aim was to provide a new molecular test to guide the treatment of new and relapsed cases. We first studied 126 H. pylori strains for phenotypic (MIC) and genotypic resistance to clarithromycin (rrl mutation) and levofloxacin (gyrA mutation) and then developed a DNA strip genotyping test on the basis of the correlation results and literature data. Clinical strains (n = 92) and gastric biopsy specimens containing H. pylori (n = 105) were tested blindly with the new molecular test GenoType HelicoDR. The presence of mutations or the absence of hybridization with wild-type sequences was predictive, in rrl for clarithromycin resistance in 91 cases (mostly the A2147G mutation) and in gyrA for levofloxacin resistance in 58 cases (mutations at codon 87 or 91). Genotyping revealed a mix of genotypes in 33\% of the cases, reflecting a coinfection or selection for resistant mutants. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting resistance were 94\% and 99\% for clarithromycin and 87\% and 98.5\% for levofloxacin, respectively. The concordance scores were 0.96 for clarithromycin and 0.94 for levofloxacin. With global resistance rates of 46\% for clarithromycin and 25\% for levofloxacin, which were observed for consecutive positive biopsy specimens from 2007 and 2008, the positive and negative predictive values for detecting resistance were 99\% and 94\% for clarithromycin and 96\% and 96\% for fluoroquinolone. GenoType HelicoDR is efficient at detecting mutations predictive of antibiotic resistance in H. pylori when applied to strains or directly to gastric biopsy specimens.},

  abstract = {IL-27 is the newest member of the cytokine family comprised of IL-12 and IL-23. IL-27 was originally described as a cytokine that along with IL-12 induces the differentiation of naive precursor T cells into Th1 effector cells. This activity has been called into question based on evidence in infectious disease and autoimmune models in which IL-27 is not absolutely required for the generation of IFN-gamma, and IL-27 plays a regulatory role in controlling inflammation. We have previously reported in proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PGIA), a model of rheumatoid arthritis, that severe arthritis is dependent on the production of IFN-gamma. In this study, we report that IL-27 was expressed in spleen and joint tissues of arthritic mice. We determined the involvement of IL-27 in PGIA by assessing the progression of arthritis in IL-27R-/- mice. Development of arthritis in IL-27R-/- mice was delayed and severity reduced in comparison with IL-27R+/+ littermate controls. Histology confirmed a reduction in joint cellularity, cartilage destruction, and bone erosion. Diminished arthritis was associated with fewer T cells producing IFN-gamma and decreased IFN-gamma secretion overtime. Moreover, the frequency of IL-4- and IL-17-expressing T cells and the production of IL-4 and IL-17 were similar in IL-27R-/- mice and controls. Our results indicate that IL-27 is critically involved in the induction of inflammation in PGIA. IL-27 functions by inducing the differentiation of IFN-gamma-producing T cells in vivo that are essential for the development of arthritis.},

  abstract = {T helper (Th) cells play a major role in the immune response and pathology at the gastric mucosa during Helicobacter pylori infection. There is a limited mechanistic understanding regarding the contributions of CD4+ T cell subsets to gastritis development during H. pylori colonization. We used two computational approaches: ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based and agent-based modeling (ABM) to study the mechanisms underlying cellular immune responses to H. pylori and how CD4+ T cell subsets influenced initiation, progression and outcome of disease. To calibrate the model, in vivo experimentation was performed by infecting C57BL/6 mice intragastrically with H. pylori and assaying immune cell subsets in the stomach and gastric lymph nodes (GLN) on days 0, 7, 14, 30 and 60 post-infection. Our computational model reproduced the dynamics of effector and regulatory pathways in the gastric lamina propria (LP) in silico. Simulation results show the induction of a Th17 response and a dominant Th1 response, together with a regulatory response characterized by high levels of mucosal Treg) cells. We also investigated the potential role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {$\gamma$} (PPAR{$\gamma$}) activation on the modulation of host responses to H. pylori by using loss-of-function approaches. Specifically, in silico results showed a predominance of Th1 and Th17 cells in the stomach of the cell-specific PPAR{$\gamma$} knockout system when compared to the wild-type simulation. Spatio-temporal, object-oriented ABM approaches suggested similar dynamics in induction of host responses showing analogous T cell distributions to ODE modeling and facilitated tracking lesion formation. In addition, sensitivity analysis predicted a crucial contribution of Th1 and Th17 effector responses as mediators of histopathological changes in the gastric mucosa during chronic stages of infection, which were experimentally validated in mice. These integrated immunoinformatics approaches characterized the induction of mucosal effector and regulatory pathways controlled by PPAR{$\gamma$} during H. pylori infection affecting disease outcomes.},

  abstract = {The development of gastritis during Helicobacter pylori infection is dependent on an activated adaptive immune response orchestrated by T helper (Th) cells. However, the relative contributions of the Th1 and Th17 subsets to gastritis and control of infection are still under investigation. To investigate the role of interleukin-21 (IL-21) in the gastric mucosa during H. pylori infection, we combined mathematical modeling of CD4(+) T cell differentiation with in vivo mechanistic studies. We infected IL-21-deficient and wild-type mice with H. pylori strain SS1 and assessed colonization, gastric inflammation, cellular infiltration, and cytokine profiles. Chronically H. pylori-infected IL-21-deficient mice had higher H. pylori colonization, significantly less gastritis, and reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared to these parameters in infected wild-type littermates. These in vivo data were used to calibrate an H. pylori infection-dependent, CD4(+) T cell-specific computational model, which then described the mechanism by which IL-21 activates the production of interferon gamma (IFN-{$\gamma$}) and IL-17 during chronic H. pylori infection. The model predicted activated expression of T-bet and ROR{$\gamma$}t and the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT1 and suggested a potential role of IL-21 in the modulation of IL-10. Driven by our modeling-derived predictions, we found reduced levels of CD4(+) splenocyte-specific tbx21 and rorc expression, reduced phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, and an increase in CD4(+) T cell-specific IL-10 expression in H. pylori-infected IL-21-deficient mice. Our results indicate that IL-21 regulates Th1 and Th17 effector responses during chronic H. pylori infection in a STAT1- and STAT3-dependent manner, therefore playing a major role controlling H. pylori infection and gastritis. Importance: Helicobacter pylori is the dominant member of the gastric microbiota in more than 50\% of the world's population. H. pylori colonization has been implicated in gastritis and gastric cancer, as infection with H. pylori is the single most common risk factor for gastric cancer. Current data suggest that, in addition to bacterial virulence factors, the magnitude and types of immune responses influence the outcome of colonization and chronic infection. This study uses a combined computational and experimental approach to investigate how IL-21, a proinflammatory T cell-derived cytokine, maintains the chronic proinflammatory T cell immune response driving chronic gastritis during H. pylori infection. This research will also provide insight into a myriad of other infectious and immune disorders in which IL-21 is increasingly recognized to play a central role. The use of IL-21-related therapies may provide treatment options for individuals chronically colonized with H. pylori as an alternative to aggressive antibiotics.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct a comprehensive global systematic review and meta-analysis on the association between Helicobacter pylori infection and IBD. As bacterial antigen cross-reactivity has been postulated to be involved in this association, published data on enterohepatic Helicobacter spp (EHS) and Campylobacter spp and IBD was also analysed. DESIGN: Electronic databases were searched up to July 2015 for all case-control studies on H. pylori infection/EHS/Campylobacter spp and IBD. Pooled ORs (P-OR) and 95\% CIs were obtained using the random effects model. Heterogeneity, sensitivity and stratified analyses were performed. RESULTS: Analyses comprising patients with Crohn's disease (CD), UC and IBD unclassified (IBDU), showed a consistent negative association between gastric H. pylori infection and IBD (P-OR: 0.43, p value {$<$}1e-10). This association appears to be stronger in patients with CD (P-OR: 0.38, p value {$<$}1e-10) and IBDU (P-OR: 0.43, p value=0.008) than UC (P-OR: 0.53, p value {$<$}1e-10). Stratification by age, ethnicity and medications showed significant results. In contrast to gastric H. pylori, non H. pylori-EHS (P-OR: 2.62, p value=0.001) and Campylobacter spp, in particular C. concisus (P-OR: 3.76, p value=0.006) and C. showae (P-OR: 2.39, p value=0.027), increase IBD risk. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection is negatively associated with IBD regardless of ethnicity, age, H. pylori detection methods and previous use of aminosalicylates and corticosteroids. Antibiotics influenced the magnitude of this association. Closely related bacteria including EHS and Campylobacter spp increase the risk of IBD. These results infer that H. pylori might exert an immunomodulatory effect in IBD.},

IL-12 family members, IL-12p70, IL-23, IL-27 and IL-35, play an important role in influencing helper T-cell differentiation. EBV-induced gene 3 can be associated with the p35 subunit of IL-12 to form the EBI3/p35 heterodimer, also called IL-35. It has been shown that IL-35 has biological activity and able to expand CD4+CD25+ Treg cells, suppress the proliferation of CD4+CD25- effector cells and inhibit Th17 cell polarization. IL-35 has been shown to be constitutively expressed by regulatory T (Treg) cells CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) and suggested to contribute to their suppressive activity. IL-35 is a crucial mediator which provokes CD4+CD25+ T cell proliferation and IL-10 generation, another well-known anti-inflammatory cytokine, along with TGFbeta cytokine. These studies suggest that IL-35, together with other successfully discovered cytokine inhibitors, represents a new potential therapeutic cytokine for chronic inflammation, autoimmunity and other immunological disorders.},

Injecting intact proteins into the mass spectrometer allows for better characterization of post-translational modifications and avoids several of the serious "inference" problems associated with peptide-based proteomics. However, successful implementation of a Top Down approach to endogenous or other biologically relevant samples often requires the use of one or more forms of separation prior to mass spectrometric analysis, which have only begun to mature for whole protein MS. Recent advances in instrumentation have been used in conjunction with new ion fragmentation using photons and electrons that allow for better (and often complete) protein characterization on cases simply not tractable even just a few years ago. Finally, the use of native electrospray mass spectrometry has shown great promise for the identification and characterization of whole protein complexes in the 100 kDa to 1 MDa regime, with prospects for complete compositional analysis for endogenous protein assemblies a viable goal over the coming few years.},

Previous studies suggested that the T-cell receptor repertoires of thymic Treg cells and induced Treg cells are biased towards self and non-self antigens, respectively, but their relative contribution in controlling immunopathology, such as colitis and other untoward inflammatory responses triggered by different types of antigens, remains unresolved. The intestine, and especially the colon, is a particularly suitable organ to study this question, given the variety of self-, microbiota- and food-derived antigens to which Treg cells and other T-cell populations are exposed. Intestinal environments can enhance conversion to a regulatory lineage and favour tolerogenic presentation of antigens to naive CD4(+) T cells, suggesting that intestinal homeostasis depends on microbiota-specific induced Treg cells. Here, to identify the origin and antigen-specificity of intestinal Treg cells, we performed single-cell and high-throughput sequencing of the T-cell receptor repertoires of CD4(+) Foxp3(+) and CD4(+) Foxp3(-) T cells, and analysed their reactivity against specific commensal species. We show that thymus-derived Treg cells constitute most Treg cells in all lymphoid and intestinal organs, including the colon, where their repertoire is heavily influenced by the composition of the microbiota. Our results suggest that thymic Treg cells, and not induced Treg cells, dominantly mediate tolerance to antigens produced by intestinal commensals.},

  abstract = {The ulcer-causing gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is the only bacterium known to colonize the harsh acidic environment of the human stomach. H. pylori survives in acidic conditions by producing urease, which catalyzes hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia thus elevating the pH of its environment. However, the manner in which H. pylori is able to swim through the viscoelastic mucus gel that coats the stomach wall remains poorly understood. Previous rheology studies on gastric mucin, the key viscoelastic component of gastric mucus, indicate that the rheology of this material is pH dependent, transitioning from a viscous solution at neutral pH to a gel in acidic conditions. Bulk rheology measurements on porcine gastric mucin (PGM) show that pH elevation by H. pylori induces a dramatic decrease in viscoelastic moduli. Microscopy studies of the motility of H. pylori in gastric mucin at acidic and neutral pH in the absence of urea show that the bacteria swim freely at high pH, and are strongly constrained at low pH. By using two-photon fluorescence microscopy to image the bacterial motility in an initially low pH mucin gel with urea present we show that the gain of translational motility by bacteria is directly correlated with a rise in pH indicated by 2',7'-Bis-(2-Carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), a pH sensitive fluorescent dye. This study indicates that the helicoidal-shaped H. pylori does not bore its way through the mucus gel like a screw through a cork as has previously been suggested, but instead achieves motility by altering the rheological properties of its environment.},

Twenty-nine different polypeptide chains are encoded by this cluster of genes, although only some of them show a significant similarity with the constitutive elements of well characterized secretion systems from other bacteria. The other cagPAI components represent almost unique proteins in this scenario. The majority of the T4SS include approximately fifteen components, taking into account either the transmembrane complex subunits, ATPases or substrate factors. The composition of the cagPAI is very complex: it includes proteins most likely involved at different levels in the pilus assembly, stabilization and processing of secreted substrate, as well as regulatory particles possibly involved in the control of the entire apparatus. Despite recent findings with respect to components that play a role in the interaction with the host cell, the function of several cagPAI proteins remains unclear or unknown. This is particularly true for those that represent unique members with no clear similarity to those of other T4SS and no obvious evidence of involvement in the secretion of CagA or induction of pro-inflammatory responses. We summarize what is known about these accessory components, both from a molecular and structural point of view, as well as their putative physiological role.},

We found that the genetic locus that contains  cagA (cag) is part of a 40-kb DNA  insertion that likely was acquired horizontally and integrated into the  chromosomal glutamate racemase gene. This pathogenicity island is  flanked by direct repeats of 31 bp. In some strains, cag  is split into a right segment (cagI) and a left segment  (cagII) by a novel insertion sequence  (IS605). In a minority of H. pylori  strains, cagI and cagII are separated by  an intervening chromosomal sequence. Nucleotide sequencing of the  23,508 base pairs that form the cagI region and the  extreme 3{${'}$} end of the cagII region reveals the presence  of 19 ORFs that code for proteins predicted to be mostly membrane  associated with one gene (cagE), which is similar to the  toxin-secretion gene of Bordetella pertussis, ptlC, and  the transport systems required for plasmid transfer, including the  virB4 gene of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.  Transposon inactivation of several of the cagI genes  abolishes induction of IL-8 expression in gastric epithelial cell  lines.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) induces gastric inflammation by inducing the activation of oxidant-sensitive transcription factor NF-{$\kappa$}B and cytokine expression in gastric epithelial cells. Since 15d-PGJ(2) inhibits NF-{$\kappa$}B activation in various cells, it may suppress H. pylori-induced inflammatory signaling and cytokine expression in gastric epithelial cells. The present study aims to determined the effect of 15d-PGJ(2) on the activation of inflammatory mediators Jak/Stat (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription) and induction of cytokine RANTES in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial AGS cells. Since NADPH oxidase is a candidate for the production of reactive oxygen species in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells, we determined the effect of 15d-PGJ(2) on the activation of NADPH oxdase. AGS cells were cultured in the presence of H. pylori treated with or without 15d-PGJ(2). The activations of NADPH oxidase and Jak1/Stat3, the levels of H(2)O(2) and RANTES in the medium, and DNA binding activity of Stat3 were assessed. A Jak/Stat3 specific inhibitor AG490 and an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) were treated to determine the direct involvement of Jak/Stat and NADPH oxidase on the production of H(2)O(2) and RANTES in H. pylori-infected cells. H. pylori induced the production of H(2)O(2) and RANTES as well as the activations of NADPH oxidase and Jak1/Stat3, which were inhibited by the treatment of 15d-PGJ(2). DPI suppressed H. pylori-induced alterations similar to 15d-PGJ(2). However, AG490 had no effect on NADPH oxidase activation, but reduced the level of RANTES in the medium released from H. pylori-infected cells. Conclusion: NADPH oxidase activation is an upstream signaling of Jak1/Stat3 activation and induction of RANTES in H. pylori-infected AGS cells. 15d-PGJ(2), inhibits the activations of NADPH oxidase and Jak1/Stat3 and RANTES expression, suggesting that 15d-PGJ(2) may be beneficial for the treatment of H. pylori-induced gastric inflammation.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-23 (IL-23), a member of the IL-12 family, is a heterodimeric cytokine that is composed of the p40 subunit of IL-12 plus a unique p19 subunit. IL-23 is critical for autoimmune inflammation, in part due to its stimulation of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A. It is less clear, however, if IL-23 is required during the immune response to pathogens. We examined the role of IL-23 during Mycobacterium bovis BCG infection. We found that IL-23 reduces the bacterial burden and promotes granuloma formation when IL-12 is absent. However, IL-23 does not contribute substantially to host resistance when IL-12 is present, as the ability to control bacterial growth and form granulomata is not affected in IL-23p19-deficient mice and mice treated with a specific anti-IL-23p19 antibody. IL-23p19-deficient mice are also able to mount an effective memory response to secondary infection with BCG. While IL-23p19-deficient mice do not produce IL-17A, this cytokine is not necessary for effective control of infection, and antibody blocking of IL-17A in both wild-type and IL-12-deficient mice also has little effect on the bacterial burden. These data suggest that IL-23 by itself does not play an essential role in the protective immune response to BCG infection; however, the presence of IL-23 can partially compensate for the absence of IL-12. Furthermore, neutralization of IL-23 or IL-17A does not increase susceptibility to mycobacterial BCG infection.},

In the context of infectious diseases, IL-17 protects the host against various classes of microorganisms but, intriguingly, can also exacerbate the severity of some infections. The regulation of IL-17 expression stems, in part, from the activity of Interleukin-23 (IL-23), which drives the maturation of different classes of IL-17-producing cells that can alter the course of infection. In this review, we analyze IL-17/IL-23 signalling in bacterial infection, and examine the interconnecting mechanisms that link immune regulation, host genetics, and microbial virulence in the context of bacterial pathogenesis. We consider the roles of IL-17 in both acute and chronic bacterial infections, with a focus on mouse models of human bacterial disease that involve infection of mucosal surfaces in the lungs, urogenital, and gastrointestinal tracts. Polymorphisms in IL-17-encoding genes in humans, which have been associated with heightened host susceptibility to some bacterial pathogens, are discussed. Finally, we examine the implications of IL-17 biology in infectious diseases for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeted at preventing bacterial infection.},

  abstract = {Virulence of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is directly linked to the pathogen's ability to glycosylate proteins; for example, Hp flagellin proteins are heavily glycosylated with the unusual nine-carbon sugar pseudaminic acid, and this modification is absolutely essential for Hp to synthesize functional flagella and colonize the host's stomach. Although Hp's glycans are linked to pathogenesis, Hp's glycome remains poorly understood; only the two flagellin glycoproteins have been firmly characterized in Hp. Evidence from our laboratory suggests that Hp synthesizes a large number of as-yet unidentified glycoproteins. Here we set out to discover Hp's glycoproteins by coupling glycan metabolic labeling with mass spectrometry analysis. An assessment of the subcellular distribution of azide-labeled proteins by Western blot analysis indicated that glycoproteins are present throughout Hp and may therefore serve diverse functions. To identify these species, Hp's azide-labeled glycoproteins were tagged via Staudinger ligation, enriched by tandem affinity chromatography, and analyzed by multidimensional protein identification technology. Direct comparison of enriched azide-labeled glycoproteins with a mock-enriched control by both SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry-based analyses confirmed the selective enrichment of azide-labeled glycoproteins. We identified 125 candidate glycoproteins with diverse biological functions, including those linked with pathogenesis. Mass spectrometry analyses of enriched azide-labeled glycoproteins before and after cleavage of O-linked glycans revealed the presence of Staudinger ligation-glycan adducts in samples only after beta-elimination, confirming the synthesis of O-linked glycoproteins in Hp. Finally, the secreted colonization factors urease alpha and urease beta were biochemically validated as glycosylated proteins via Western blot analysis as well as by mass spectrometry analysis of cleaved glycan products. These data set the stage for the development of glycosylation-based therapeutic strategies, such as new vaccines based on natively glycosylated Hp proteins, to eradicate Hp infection. Broadly, this report validates metabolic labeling as an effective and efficient approach for the identification of bacterial glycoproteins.},

These cells produce IL-17 (also called IL-17A) and IL-17F, two most homologous cytokines sharing similar regulations. Here we report that when overexpressed in 293T cells, IL-17 and IL-17F form not only homodimers but also heterodimers, which we name as IL-17A/F. Fully differentiated mouse THi cells also naturally secrete IL-17A/F as well as IL-17 and IL-17F homodimeric cytokines. Recombinant IL-17A/F protein exhibits intermediate levels of potency in inducing IL-6 and KC (CXCL1) as compared to homodimeric cytokines. IL-17A/F regulation of IL-6 and KC expression is dependent on IL-17RA and TRAF6. Thus, IL-17A/F cytokine represents another mechanism whereby T cells regulate inflammatory responses and may serve as a novel target for treating various immune-mediated diseases.},

We describe here a third DC lineage, termed interferon-producing killer DCs (IKDCs), distinct from conventional DCs and plasmacytoid DCs and with the molecular expression profile of both NK cells and DCs. They produce substantial amounts of type I interferons (IFN) and interleukin (IL)-12 or IFN-gamma, depending on activation stimuli. Upon stimulation with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, ligands for Toll-like receptor (TLR)-9, IKDCs kill typical NK target cells using NK-activating receptors. Their cytolytic capacity subsequently diminishes, associated with the loss of NKG2D receptor (also known as Klrk1) and its adaptors, Dap10 and Dap12. As cytotoxicity is lost, DC-like antigen-presenting activity is gained, associated with upregulation of surface major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) and costimulatory molecules, which formally distinguish them from classical NK cells. In vivo, splenic IKDCs preferentially show NK function and, upon systemic infection, migrate to lymph nodes, where they primarily show antigen-presenting cell activity. By virtue of their capacity to kill target cells, followed by antigen presentation, IKDCs provide a link between innate and adaptive immunity.},

Although IL-35 has been shown to play an important role in Treg-mediated suppression in mice, recent studies have questioned its relevance in human Treg. In this study, we show that human Treg express and require IL-35 for maximal suppressive capacity. Substantial upregulation of EBI3 and IL12A, but not IL10 and TGFB, was observed in activated human Treg compared with conventional T cells (Tconv). Contact-independent Treg-mediated suppression was IL-35 dependent and did not require IL-10 or TGF-{$\beta$}. Lastly, human Treg-mediated suppression led to the conversion of the suppressed Tconv into iTr35 cells, an IL-35\textendash induced Treg population, in an IL-35\textendash dependent manner. Thus, IL-35 contributes to human Treg-mediated suppression, and its conversion of suppressed target Tconv into IL-35\textendash induced Treg may contribute to infectious tolerance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection has been suggested to be related to a decreased risk of asthma, but findings in the literature are inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively summarize the existing evidence on the association between H pylori infection and asthma risk. METHODS: The PubMed database was searched for observational studies of H pylori infection in relation to the risk of asthma published in English through May 2017. Measurements of association were pooled using a meta-analytic approach and expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs). RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were identified in this meta-analysis, including 8 case-control studies composed of 1,247 cases and 2,410 controls, and 16 cross-sectional studies composed of 50,290 participants (4,185 cases and 46,105 noncases). The average H pylori infection rates were 40.01\% and 48.74\% in case-control and cross-sectional studies, respectively. Five studies subcategorized H pylori infection according to CagA status, in which 59.37\% of H pylori-infected participants were identified as having CagA positivity. Helicobacter pylori infection was significantly inversely associated with the risk of asthma in case-control studies (OR 0.83, 95\% CI 0.71-0.98) but was borderline significant in cross-sectional studies (OR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.76-1.02). The observed inverse association persisted for CagA-positive H pylori infection (OR 0.77, 95\% CI 0.63-0.93, P for interaction~= .03) but not for CagA-negative strains (OR 1.08, 95\% CI 0.66-1.78). No significant difference was observed across age or region subgroups. CONCLUSION: The accumulated evidence supports that H pylori infection, especially CagA-positive H pylori infection, is inversely associated with the risk of asthma.},

Thus, it is important to evaluate its influence on total and category-specific mortality. DESIGN: We conducted prospective cohort analyses in a nationally representative sample of 9895 participants enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III to assess the association of H pylori status with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Analyses for the association of H pylori cagA positivity with mortality were conducted in 7384 subjects with data on H pylori cagA status. RESULTS: In older people ({$>$} 40.1 years), H pylori was not associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1.00; 95\% CI 0.84 to 1.18). There was an inverse association of H pylori status with stroke mortality (HR 0.69; 95\% CI 0.44 to 1.08), and the inverse association was stronger for H pylori cagA positivity, with the HR of 0.45 (95\% CI 0.27 to 0.76). H pylori was also strongly positively related to gastric cancer mortality. After we adjusted p values using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate method to account for multiple comparisons, these associations remained, and H pylori status was not related to other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that H pylori has a mixed role in human health, but is not a major risk factor for all-cause mortality.},

One critical question is whether Treg can only be generated in the thymus or can differentiate from peripheral CD4+CD25- naive T cells. In this paper, we present novel evidence that conversion of naive peripheral CD4+CD25- T cells into anergic/suppressor cells that are CD25+, CD45RB-/low and intracellular CTLA-4+ can be achieved through costimulation with T cell receptors (TCRs) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). Although transcription factor Foxp3 has been shown recently to be associated with the development of Treg, the physiological inducers for Foxp3 gene expression remain a mystery. TGF-beta induced Foxp3 gene expression in TCR-challenged CD4+CD25- naive T cells, which mediated their transition toward a regulatory T cell phenotype with potent immunosuppressive potential. These converted anergic/suppressor cells are not only unresponsive to TCR stimulation and produce neither T helper cell 1 nor T helper cell 2 cytokines but they also express TGF-beta and inhibit normal T cell proliferation in vitro. More importantly, in an ovalbumin peptide TCR transgenic adoptive transfer model, TGF-beta-converted transgenic CD4+CD25+ suppressor cells proliferated in response to immunization and inhibited antigen-specific naive CD4+ T cell expansion in vivo. Finally, in a murine asthma model, coadministration of these TGF-beta-induced suppressor T cells prevented house dust mite-induced allergic pathogenesis in lungs.},

This process of T-helper cell differentiation is tightly regulated by cytokines. Here we report a new member of the type I cytokine receptor family, designated T-cell cytokine receptor (TCCR). When challenged in vivo with protein antigen, TCCR-deficient mice had impaired Th1 response as measured by IFN- production. TCCR-deficient mice also had increased susceptibility to infection with an intracellular pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes. In addition, levels of antigen-specific immunoglobulin-2a, which are dependent on Th1 cells, were markedly reduced in these mice.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Immunodominance is an important feature of antiviral, antitumor, and antibacterial cellular immune responses, but it is not well demonstrated in the immune responses against Helicobacter pylori. Antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells protect mice against infection with H pylori. We investigated the immunodominant CD4(+) T-cell response to neuraminyllactose-binding hemagglutinin (HpaA), which is a conserved, H pylori-specific colonization factor that is being investigated as an antigen for vaccination strategies. METHODS: HpaA-specific CD4(+) T cells were expanded with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells that had been incubated with recombinant HpaA and characterized using overlapping synthetic peptides. We compared the percentage of CD4(+) T cells with specificity for HpaA(88-100), restricted to HLA-DRB1*1501, among 59 H pylori-infected subjects with different gastric diseases. RESULTS: We identified and characterized several immunodominant CD4(+) T-cell epitopes derived from HpaA. The immunodominant CD4(+) T-cell responses specific to HpaA(88-100) were observed in most H pylori-infected individuals who expressed HLA-DRB1*1501 and were significantly more abundant in patients with less severe diseases (P {$<$} .05). CONCLUSIONS: The HLA-DRB1*1501-restricted immunodominant CD4(+) T-cell response to HpaA(88-100) is associated with reduced risk of severe gastric diseases. Further study of these and other immunodominant CD4(+) T-cell responses to H pylori will provide insight into mechanisms of protective immunity and aid in vaccine design.},

The H. pylori outer inflammatory protein (oipA) has been demonstrated to be a potential antigen for a vaccine. In the present study, use of oipA gene encoded construct (poipA) for C57BL/6 mice vaccination was investigated. Whether co-delivery of IL-2 gene encoded construct (pIL-2) and B subunit heat-labile toxin of Escherichia coli gene encoded construct (pLTB) can modulate the immune response and enhance DNA vaccine efficacy was also explored. Our results demonstrated that poipA administered intradermally ('gene gun' immunization) promoted a strong Th2 immune response, whereas co-delivery of either pIL-2 or pLTB adjuvant elicited a Th1-biased immune response. PoipA administered with both pIL-2 and pLTB adjuvants promoted a strong Th1 immune response. Regardless of the different immune responses promoted by the various vaccination regimes, all immunized mice had smaller bacterial loads after H. pylori challenge than did PBS negative and pVAX1 mock controls. Co-delivery of adjuvant(s) enhances poipA DNA vaccine efficacy by shifting the immune response from being Th2 to being Th1-biased, which results in a greater reduction in bacterial load after H. pylori challenge. Both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination can achieve sterile immunity in some subjects.},

To develop an oral vaccine against H. pylori infection, we had expressed the H. pylori ureB gene (Genbank accession no. FJ436980) in nisin-controlled expression vectors using Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 as host. The ureB gene was amplified by PCR from a H.pylori strain MEL-Hp27. Then the ureB gene was fused translationally downstream of the nisin-inducible promoter nisA in a L. lactis plasmid pNZ8149. Lactose utilization based on the complementation of the lacF gene was used as a dominant selection marker for the food-grade expression system employing L. lactis NZ3900. The conditions of UreB expression in this system were optimized by orthogonal experiment. The optimized conditions have been determined as follows: induction of expression was carried out at the cells density of OD(600) {$\approx$} 0.4 with 25 ng/ml nisin, and harvest after 5 h. The maximum percentage of recombinant UreB was estimated to be 7\% of total soluble cellular proteins and the yield was 12.9 {$\mu$}g/ml. Western blot demonstrated that the UreB protein was expressed in the L. lactis transformant and had favorable immunoreactivity. These results indicated that the lactococci-derived vaccines could be promising candidates as alternative vaccine strategies for preventing H. pylori infection.},

Expression of CD4, CD25 and Foxp3 was determined by immunohistochemistry in three consecutive sections per sample. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, there was an increased number of CD25(+) and Foxp3(+) cells in patients with gastritis (P = 0.004 and P = 0.008), peptic ulcer (P {$<$} 0.001 and P {$<$} 0.001), and gastric cancer (P {$<$} 0.001 and P {$<$} 0.001). The ratio of CD25(+)/CD4(+) or Foxp3(+)/CD4(+) cells was also significantly higher in all disease groups (P {$<$} 0.001, respectively). The number of CD4(+), CD25(+), and Foxp3(+) cells, and the ratio of CD25(+)/CD4(+) and Foxp3(+)/CD4(+) cells, were associated with the histological grade of the specimens, including acute inflammation, chronic inflammation, lymphoid follicle number, and Helicobacter pylori infection. The number of CD4(+), CD25(+) and Foxp3(+) cells, and the ratio of CD25(+)/CD4(+) and Foxp3(+)/CD4(+) cells, were negatively associated with intestinal metaplasia among gastritis (P {$<$} 0.001, P {$<$} 0.001, P {$<$} 0.001, P = 0.002 and P = 0.002) and peptic ulcer groups (P = 0.013, P = 0.004, P {$<$} 0.001, P = 0.040 and P = 0.003).

METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional analyses, using data from 7412 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2000, to assess the association between H. pylori and childhood asthma. RESULTS: H. pylori seropositivity was inversely associated with onset of asthma before 5 years of age and current asthma in children aged 3-13 years. Among participants 3-19 years of age, the presence of H. pylori was inversely related to ever having had asthma (odds ratio [OR], 0.69; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-1.06), and the inverse association with onset of asthma before 5 years of age was stronger (OR, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.38-0.88). Among participants 3-13 years of age, H. pylori positivity was significantly inversely associated with current asthma (OR, 0.41; 95\% CI, 0.24-0.69). H. pylori seropositivity also was inversely related to recent wheezing, allergic rhinitis, and dermatitis, eczema, or rash. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to report an inverse association between H. pylori seropositivity and asthma in children.

  abstract = {UNLABELLED Today, the causal relationship between inflammation and gastric cancer is more widely accepted. Genetic variations in inflammation-related genes especially cytokines and their receptors, were thought to partly determine the outcome of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and progression of gastric lesions. Interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R), as a key cytokine receptor gene in the important inflammatory IL-17/IL-23 axis, may contribute to gastric cancer predisposition. Up till now, the associations of IL23R gene polymorphisms with subtypes of gastric cancer are largely unknown. AIMS We investigated whether the association between IL23R +2199 rs10889677 and gastric cancer risk varies by clinical characteristics and the prognostic value of the polymorphism in a case-control study. METHODS A population-based case-control study was conducted in Guangdong. 1010 gastric cancer patients and 800 healthy controls were enrolled. Polymorphism in IL23R was analyzed by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS Compared with AA, CC carriers of IL23R +2199 polymorphism were associated with protection against gastric cancer (OR=0.47, 95\% CI=0.31-0.71). In stratified analyses, CC genotype was significantly associated with decreased risk of intestinal type (OR=0.44, 95\% CI=0.27-0.70), but not with diffuse or mix type of gastric cancer. CC genotype was found to be associated with poorly differentiated (OR=0.43, 95\% CI=0.26-0.70), but not with moderately or well differentiated gastric cancer. Multivariate analysis showed IL23R +2199A/C variant was not an independent prognostic factor for gastric cancer patients. CONCLUSION IL23R polymorphism influences certain subtypes of gastric cancer according to clinical and pathological features. Understanding the etiologic heterogeneity of gastric cancer may result in improvements in controlling this disorder.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is associated with remodeling of gastric microbiota. However, comprehensive analyses of the impact of H. pylori infection, eradication therapy and probiotic supplementation on gut microbiota are still lacking. We aimed to provide evidence for clinical decision making. METHODS: Seventy H. pylori-positive and 35 H. pylori-negative patients (group C) were enrolled. H. pylori-positive patients were randomly assigned to group A (14-day bismuth-containing quadruple therapy) and group B (quadruple therapy supplemented with Clostridium butyricum). Stool samples of group A and B were collected on day 0, 14 and 56 while stool samples of group C were collected on day 0. Gut microbiota was investigated by 16S rRNA sequencing. FINDINGS: The Sobs index (richness estimator) was significantly higher in H. pylori-positive samples than H. pylori-negative samples (p\,{$<$}\,.05). Several metabolic pathways were more abundant in H. pylori-positive communities while some disease-associated pathways had higher potential in H. pylori-negative community through KEGG pathway analysis. Abundances of most butyrate-producing bacteria significantly decreased, while several detrimental bacteria increased after eradication therapy. Probiotic supplementation was associated with improved gastrointestinal symptoms as well as increased Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio. INTERPRETATION: While H. pylori infection may not be necessarily detrimental in all patients, eradication of H. pylori was associated with widespread changes in gut microbial ecology and structure. Probiotic supplementation could relieve more gastrointestinal symptoms by inducing alterations in gut microbiota and host immune responses. As such, the decision to eradicate H. pylori should be based on comprehensive analysis of individual patients.},

We found that the variant allele (G) of rs1884444 T{$>$}G, with amino acid His substituted by Gln at codon 3, was significantly associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer [adjusted allelic odds ratio (OR)\,= 0.78, 95\% confidence interval (CI)\,= 0.68-0.88]. In the stratified analysis, we found that this protective effect of rs1884444 G allele was mainly evident in intestinal-type gastric cancer (adjusted allelic OR = 0.75, 95\% CI = 0.65-0.87) other than in diffuse-type gastric cancer (adjusted allelic OR = 0.96, 95\% CI = 0.76-1.22).

The Salmonella-delivered wild type oipA construct (SL7207/poipA) and the Salmonella-delivered codon-optimized oipA construct (SL7207/poipA-opt) were prepared and their therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in H. pylori-infected mice.

Oral therapeutic immunization with SL7207/poipA-opt significantly eliminated H. pylori colonization in the stomach; and protection was related to a robust Th1/Th2 immune response. Therefore, our results suggested that fine therapeutic efficacy was related to sufficient expression of the antigen. It is supposed that codon-optimized oipA gene improves protein expression and consequently enhances the immunogenicity of DNA vaccine, which resulted in a significant reduction of bacterial loads in H. pylori infected mice.

  abstract = {IL-17A and IL-17F are members of the IL-17 family that play crucial roles in allergic inflammation. Recent studies reported that IL-17A and IL-17F production from a distinct Th lymphocyte subset, Th17, was specifically induced by IL-23, which was produced by dendritic cells and macrophages in response to microbial stimuli. The IL-23-IL-17 axis might therefore provide a link between infections and allergic diseases. In the present study, we investigated the effects of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-23, alone or in combination, on cytokine and chemokine release from eosinophils and the underlying intracellular mechanisms. Human eosinophils were found to constitutively express receptors for IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-23 at the protein level. IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-23 could induce the release of chemokines GRO-alpha/CXCL1, IL-8/CXCL8, and MIP-1beta/CCL4 from eosinophils, while IL-17F and IL-23 could also increase the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6. Synergistic effects were observed in the combined treatment of IL-17F and IL-23 on the release of proinflammatory cytokines, and the effects were dose-dependently enhanced by IL-23, but not IL-17F. Further investigations showed that IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-23 differentially activated the ERK, p38 MAPK, and NF-kappaB pathways. Moreover, inhibition of these pathways using selective inhibitors could significantly abolish the chemokine release induced by IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-23 and the synergistic increases on IL-1beta and IL-6 production mediated by combined treatment of IL-17F and IL-23. Taken together, our findings provide insight for the Th17 lymphocyte-mediated activation of eosinophils via differential intracellular signaling cascades in allergic inflammation.},

  abstract = {Chronic inflammation, regardless of infectious agents, plays important roles in the development of various cancers, particularly in digestive organs, including Helicobacter pylori-associated gastric cancer, hepatitis C virus-positive hepatocellular carcinoma, and colitis-associated colon cancers. Cancer development is characterized by stepwise accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations of various proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. During chronic inflammation, infectious agents such as H pylori and hepatitis C virus as well as intrinsic mediators of inflammatory responses, including proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, can induce genetic and epigenetic changes, including point mutations, deletions, duplications, recombinations, and methylation of various tumor-related genes through various mechanisms. Furthermore, inflammation also modulates the expressions of microRNAs that influence the production of several tumor-related messenger RNAs or proteins. These molecular events induced by chronic inflammation work in concert to alter important pathways involved in normal cellular function, and hence accelerate inflammation-associated cancer development. Among these, recent studies highlighted an important role of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, a nucleotide-editing enzyme essential for somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination of the immunoglobulin gene, as a genomic modulator in inflammation-associated cancer development.},

  abstract = {As the majority of human pathogens infect via a mucosal surface, delivery of killed vaccines by mucosal routes could potentially improve protection against many such organisms. Our ability to develop effective killed mucosal vaccines is inhibited by a lack of adjuvants that are safe and effective in humans. The Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I) lectin specifically binds M cells lining the murine gastrointestinal tract. We explored the potential for M-cell-targeted vaccination of whole, killed Helicobacter pylori, the main causative agent of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer, and Campylobacter jejuni, the most common cause of diarrhea. Oral delivery of UEA-I-agglutinated H. pylori or C. jejuni induced a significant increase in both serum and intestinal antibody levels. This elevated response (i) required the use of whole bacteria, as it did not occur with lysate; (ii) was not mediated by formation of particulate clumps, as agglutination with a lectin with a different glycan specificity had no effect; and (iii) was not due to lectin-mediated, nonspecific immunostimulatory activity, as UEA-I codelivery with nonagglutinated bacteria did not enhance the response. Vaccination with UEA-I-agglutinated, killed whole H. pylori induced a protective response against subsequent live challenge that was as effective as that induced by cholera toxin adjuvant. Moreover, vaccination against C. jejuni by this approach resulted in complete protection against challenge in almost all animals. We believe that this is the first demonstration that targeting of whole killed bacteria to mucosal M cells can induce protective immunity without the addition of an immunostimulatory adjuvant.},

To assess the role of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in Th expansion, we activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells by CD3 cross-linking. In the presence of exogenous PGE(2), peripheral blood mononuclear cells produced higher interleukin-17 (IL-17), C-C chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20)/macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha (MIP-3alpha), CXC chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8)/IL-8, and lower interferon-gamma and IL-22 levels than in control cultures. Exogenous PGE(2) and IL-23 synergized in inducing IL-17, whereas indomethacin and IL-23 blockade drastically reduced IL-17 but not interferon-gamma production. Furthermore, IL-1 but not tumor necrosis factor was absolutely required for IL-17 production. PGE(2) doubled the frequency of CD4+ T cells producing IL-17 and within the CD4+ subset enhanced C-C chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) and CCR4 while decreasing CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) expression. Furthermore, in CD4+ T-cell lines, the production of IL-17 segregated with the CCR6+ subset. In the presence of CCR6+ compared with CXCR3+ Th cells, monocytes/macrophages produced much higher levels of matrix metalloproteinase-1, -3, and -9 but similar levels of CXCL10 and IL-1beta. These results identify PGE(2) and IL-23 as participating in the expansion of CD4+ T cells endowed with high IL-17 production capacity, which in turn favors monocyte production of mediators important for host defense and tissue destruction.},

  abstract = {IL-12 is a 75-kDa heterodimeric cytokine composed of disulfide-bonded 35-kDa and 40-kDa subunits. Included among the biologic activities mediated by IL-12 is induction of proliferation of PHA-activated human PBL. The concentration of IL-12 required to stimulate maximum proliferation of PHA-activated lymphoblasts is 50 to 100 pM. In this study, highly purified 125I-labeled IL-12 (7 to 15 microCi/microgram; 50 to 100\% bioactive) was used to characterize the receptor for IL-12 on 4-day PHA-activated lymphoblasts. The binding of 125I-labeled IL-12 to PHA-activated lymphoblasts was saturable and specific because the binding of radiolabeled ligand was only inhibited by IL-12 and not by other cytokines. The kinetics of [125I]IL-12 binding to PHA-activated lymphoblasts was rapid at both 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C; reaching equilibrium within 60 min. At 22 degrees C, the rate of dissociation of [125I]IL-12 was slow in the absence of competing IL-12 (t1/2 = 5.9 h) and more rapid in the presence of 25 nM competing IL-12 (t1/2 = 2.5 h). The kinetically derived equilibrium dissociation constant ranged from 10 to 83 pM. Analysis of steady state binding data by the method of Scatchard identified a single binding site with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of 100 to 600 pM and 1000 to 9000 sites/lymphoblast. The equilibrium dissociation constant for competing ligands and sites per cell calculated from unlabeled IL-12 competition experiments ranged from 164 to 315 pM and 1067 to 3336, respectively, which is in good agreement with the values determined from steady state binding. The variations in KD and sites per cell were dependent on the individual preparations of lymphoblasts. Although the steady state binding data were consistent with a single class of high affinity binding sites, the kinetic dissociation data indicates a cooperative interaction between receptors on PHA-activated lymphoblasts. Affinity cross-linking of surface bound [125I]IL-12 to PHA-activated lymphoblasts at 4 degrees C identified a major complex of approximately 210 to 280 kDa. Anti-IL-12 antibodies also immunoprecipitated a complex of approximately 210 to 280 kDa that was produced by cross-linking unlabeled IL-12 to 125I-labeled lymphoblast cell-surface proteins. Cleavage of this complex with reducing agent identified one radiolabeled protein of approximately 110 kDa. These data suggest that the IL-12 binding site on PHA-activated lymphoblasts may be composed of a single protein of approximately 110 kDa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Regulatory T (Treg) cells, which suppress the immune response of antigen-specific T cells, have recently been demonstrated to play a key role in chronic inflammation by immunologic tolerance. The purpose of our study was to investigate the histopathology, FOXP3+CD4+CD25(high)Treg (FOXP3+Treg) cell expression, and immune responses in children with H. pylori infection. Twenty-four H. pylori -positive and 24 H. pylori -negative children who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy for dyspeptic symptoms were included. Histopathologic grading according to the updated Sydney classification and immunohistochemical stains for FOXP3, transforming growth factor-{$\beta$}1 (TGF-{$\beta$}1), and CD4 were performed. Histopathologic bacterial density score, gastritis activity score, and chronic inflammation score were higher in the H. pylori -positive group than in the negative group (P {$<$} 0.01). The number of FOXP3+Treg cells and CD4+T cells and the grade of TGF-{$\beta$}1 expression were significantly increased in the H. pylori -positive group compared to the negative group (P {$<$} 0.01). The number of FOXP3+Treg cells correlated positively with the grade of TGF-{$\beta$}1 expression regardless of H. pylori status (P {$<$} 0.05). The number of FOXP3+Treg cells and the grade of TGF-{$\beta$}1 expression correlated positively with H. pylori density, gastritis activity score, and chronic inflammation score regardless of H. pylori status (P {$<$} 0.01). These findings indicate that FOXP3+Treg cells could play a role in persistent H. pylori infection.},

  abstract = {An important consideration in the development of subunit vaccines is the loss of activity caused by physical instability of the protein. Such instability often results from suboptimal solution conditions related to pH and temperature. Excipients can help to stabilize vaccines, but it is important to screen and identify excipients that adequately contribute to stabilization of a given formulation. CagL is a protein present in strains of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) that possess type IV secretion systems. It contributes to bacterial adherence via {$\alpha$}5{$\beta$}1 integrin, thereby making it an attractive subunit vaccine candidate. We characterized the stability of CagL in different pH and temperature conditions using a variety of spectroscopic techniques. Stability was assessed in terms of transition temperature with the accumulated data, and then incorporated into an empirical phase diagram (EPD) that provided an overview of CagL physical stability. These analyses indicated maximum CagL stability at pH 4-6 up to 40\textdegree C in the absence of excipient. Using this EPD analysis, aggregation assays were developed to screen a panel of excipients with some found to inhibit CagL aggregation. Candidate stabilizers were selected to confirm their enhanced stabilizing effect. These analyses will help in the formulation of a stable vaccine against H. pylori.},

  abstract = {The bacterial type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) translocate DNA and protein substrates to bacterial or eukaryotic target cells generally by a mechanism dependent on direct cell-to-cell contact. The T4SSs encompass two large subfamilies, the conjugation systems and the effector translocators. The conjugation systems mediate interbacterial DNA transfer and are responsible for the rapid dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence determinants in clinical settings. The effector translocators are used by many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens for delivery of potentially hundreds of virulence proteins to eukaryotic cells for modulation of different physiological processes during infection. Recently, there has been considerable progress in defining the structures of T4SS machine subunits and large machine subassemblies. Additionally, the nature of substrate translocation sequences and the contributions of accessory proteins to substrate docking with the translocation channel have been elucidated. A DNA translocation route through the Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB/VirD4 system was defined, and both intracellular (DNA ligand, ATP energy) and extracellular (phage binding) signals were shown to activate type IV-dependent translocation. Finally, phylogenetic studies have shed light on the evolution and distribution of T4SSs, and complementary structure-function studies of diverse systems have identified adaptations tailored for novel functions in pathogenic settings. This review summarizes the recent progress in our understanding of the architecture and mechanism of action of these fascinating machines, with emphasis on the 'archetypal' A. tumefaciens VirB/VirD4 T4SS and related conjugation systems.

  abstract = {A cDNA encoding a human IL-12R subunit was isolated by expression cloning. This subunit is a 662 amino acid type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain of 516 amino acids and a cytoplasmic domain of 91 amino acids. It is a member of the hemopoietin receptor superfamily and is most closely related over its entire length to gp130 and the receptors for granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) and leukemia-inhibitory factor. When expressed in COS cells, this IL-12R subunit binds both human and murine IL-12 with an apparent affinity of 2 to 5 nM. The transfected COS cells express both monomers and disulfide-linked dimers or oligomers of the IL-12R subunit on their surface. However, unlike the IL-6-induced dimerization of gp130, the oligomerization of the IL-12R subunit is not dependent on binding of IL-12. Only the IL-12R subunit dimers/oligomers but not the monomers bind IL-12 with an affinity of 2 to 5 nM. A polyclonal antiserum raised against this receptor subunit specifically inhibits IL-12-induced proliferation of PHA-activated PBMC. The data are consistent with the hypotheses that 1) a dimer/oligomer of the cloned IL-12R subunit (IL-12R-beta) represents the low affinity IL-12 binding site identified on human lymphoblasts, 2) the cloned receptor subunit is involved in IL-12 signal transduction, and 3) an additional, as of yet unidentified subunit is required to generate a high affinity IL-12R complex.},

The specimens were processed for electron microscopy and observed with a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi H-600). RESULTS: On the basis of morphological appearances, the adhesions of H. pylori to the gastric epithelial cells were categorized into three types; filamentous connection, adhesion pedestals and membrane fusion. Coccoid and undetermined forms adhered mainly by the filamentous connection, whereas the bacillary forms adhered primarily by the adhesion pedestals and membrane fusion. CONCLUSION: Various types of adhesion were associated with H. pylori and gastric epithelium. Further studies are needed to evaluate the influence of different types of adhesion to the pathophysiology of H. pylori.},

HMb mouse intestines had low levels of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, few proliferating T cells, few dendritic cells, and low antimicrobial peptide expression--all characteristics of GF mice. Rat microbiota also failed to fully expand intestinal T cell numbers in mice. Colonizing GF or HMb mice with mouse-segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) partially restored T cell numbers, suggesting that SFB and other MMb organisms are required for full immune maturation in mice.

METHODS: We examined 107 patients with gastric epithelial dysplasia who had undergone endoscopic mucosal resection or submucosal dissection. All tissue samples were evaluated by RUNX3 staining and subclassified by immunophenotype. H. pylori infection in dysplastic lesions and the normal surrounding tissue was examined by silver staining, and cagA status was assessed by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The loss of RUNX3 expression was observed in 62 cases (57.9\%), and an association with H. pylori infection was found in 54 cases (50.5\%). The infection rate with the cagA-positive H. pylori strain was 63.0\%. In RUNX3-negative lesions, the rate of H. pylori infection (p=0.03) and the frequency of category 4 lesions (according to the revised Vienna classification) were high (p=0.02). In addition, the gastric mucin phenotype was predominant. In RUNX3-negative category 4 lesions, the rate of cagA-positive H. pylori infection rate was high but not significantly increased (p=0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Infection with H. pylori is associated with inactivation of RUNX3 in early gastric carcinogenesis. This mechanism was prominent in gastric cancer with a gastric mucin phenotype.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori colonises the human stomach and has tropism for the gastric mucin, MUC5AC. The majority of organisms live in the adherent mucus layer within their preferred location, close to the epithelial surface where the pH is near neutral. Trefoil factor 1 (TFF1) is a small trefoil protein co-expressed with the gastric mucin MUC5AC in surface foveolar cells and co-secreted with MUC5AC into gastric mucus. Helicobacter pylori binds with greater avidity to TFF1 dimer, which is present in gastric mucus, than to TFF1 monomer. Binding of H. pylori to TFF1 is mediated by the core oligosaccharide subunit of H. pylori lipopolysaccharide at pH 5.0-6.0. Treatment of H. pylori lipopolysaccharide with mannosidase or glucosidase inhibits its interaction with TFF1. Both TFF1 and H. pylori have a propensity for binding to mucins with terminal non-reducing {$\alpha$}- or {$\beta$}-linked N-acetyl-d-glucosamine or {$\alpha$}-(2,3) linked sialic acid or Gal-3-SO42-. These findings are strong evidence that TFF1 has carbohydrate-binding properties that may involve a conserved patch of aromatic hydrophobic residues on the surface of its trefoil domain. The pH-dependent lectin properties of TFF1 may serve to locate H. pylori deep in the gastric mucus layer close to the epithelium rather than at the epithelial surface. This restricted localisation could limit the interaction of H. pylori with epithelial cells and the subsequent host signalling events that promote inflammation.},

Autoreactive helper T cells specifically lacking GM-CSF failed to initiate neuroinflammation despite expression of IL-17A or IFN-{$\gamma$}, whereas GM-CSF secretion by Ifng(-/-)Il17a(-/-) helper T cells was sufficient to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). During the disease effector phase, GM-CSF sustained neuroinflammation via myeloid cells that infiltrated the central nervous system. Thus, in contrast to all other known helper T cell-derived cytokines, GM-CSF serves a nonredundant function in the initiation of autoimmune inflammation regardless of helper T cell polarization.},

We found that iTR35 cells did not express or require the transcription factor Foxp3, and were strongly suppressive and stable in vivo. Treg cells induced the generation of iTR35 cells in an IL-35- and IL-10-dependent manner in vitro and induced their generation in vivo under inflammatory conditions in intestines infected with Trichuris muris and within the tumor microenvironment (B16 melanoma and MC38 colorectal adenocarcinoma), where they contributed to the regulatory milieu. Thus, iTR35 cells constitute a key mediator of infectious tolerance and contribute to Treg cell\textendash mediated tumor progression. Furthermore, iTR35 cells generated ex vivo might have therapeutic utility.},

  abstract = {Regulatory T (Treg) cells are a critical sub-population of CD4+ T cells that are essential for maintaining self tolerance and preventing autoimmunity, for limiting chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease, and for regulating homeostatic lymphocyte expansion. However, they also suppress natural immune responses to parasites and viruses as well as anti-tumour immunity induced by therapeutic vaccines. Although the manipulation of Treg function is an important goal of immunotherapy, the molecules that mediate their suppressive activity remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that Epstein-Barr-virus-induced gene 3 (Ebi3, which encodes IL-27{$\beta$}) and interleukin-12 alpha (Il12a, which encodes IL-12{$\alpha$}/p35) are highly expressed by mouse Foxp3+ (forkhead box P3) Treg cells but not by resting or activated effector CD4+ T (Teff) cells, and that an Ebi3\textendash IL-12{$\alpha$} heterodimer is constitutively secreted by Treg but not Teff cells. Both Ebi3 and Il12a messenger RNA are markedly upregulated in Treg cells co-cultured with Teff cells, thereby boosting Ebi3 and IL-12{$\alpha$} production in trans. Treg-cell restriction of this cytokine occurs because Ebi3 is a downstream target of Foxp3, a transcription factor that is required for Treg-cell development and function. Ebi3\textendash/\textendash{} and Il12a\textendash/\textendash{} Treg cells have significantly reduced regulatory activity in vitro and fail to control homeostatic proliferation and to cure inflammatory bowel disease in vivo. Because these phenotypic characteristics are distinct from those of other IL-12 family members, this novel Ebi3\textendash IL-12{$\alpha$} heterodimeric cytokine has been designated interleukin-35 (IL-35). Ectopic expression of IL-35 confers regulatory activity on naive T cells, whereas recombinant IL-35 suppresses T-cell proliferation. Taken together, these data identify IL-35 as a novel inhibitory cytokine that may be specifically produced by Treg cells and is required for maximal suppressive activity.},

Differences between transcriptomic and proteomic studies pointed to regulations occurring at the posttranscriptional level, including the control of mRNA translation. In this study, we investigated at the genome-wide level the translational regulation occurring during HCV infection. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation followed by microarray analysis was used to identify translationally regulated mRNAs (mRNAs associated with ribosomes) from JFH1-infected and uninfected Huh-7.5.1 cells. Translationally regulated mRNAs were found to correspond to genes enriched in specific pathways, including vesicular transport and posttranscriptional regulation. Interestingly, the strongest translational regulation was found for mRNAs encoding proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA translation, and protein folding. Strikingly, these pathways were not previously identified, through transcriptomic studies, as being modulated following HCV infection. Importantly, the observed changes in host mRNA translation were directly due to HCV replication rather than to HCV entry, since they were not observed in JFH1-infected Huh-7.5.1 cells treated with a potent HCV NS3 protease inhibitor. Overall, this study highlights the need to consider, beyond transcriptomic or proteomic studies, the modulation of host mRNA translation as an important aspect of HCV infection.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is a specific gastric pathogen that colonizes the stomach in more than 50\% of the world's human population. Infection with this bacterium can induce several types of gastric pathology, ranging from chronic gastritis to peptic ulcers and even adenocarcinoma. Virulent H. pylori isolates encode components of a type IV secretion system (T4SS), which form a pilus for the injection of virulence proteins such as CagA into host target cells. This is accomplished by a specialized adhesin on the pilus surface, the protein CagL, a putative VirB5 ortholog, which binds to host cell {$\beta$}(1) integrin, triggering subsequent delivery of CagA across the host cell membrane. Like the human extracellular matrix protein fibronectin, CagL contains an RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif and is able to trigger intracellular signaling pathways by RGD-dependent binding to integrins. While CagL binding to host cells is mediated primarily by the RGD motif, we identified an auxiliary binding motif for CagL-integrin interaction. Here, we report on a surface exposed FEANE (Phe-Glu-Ala-Asn-Glu) interaction motif in spatial proximity to the RGD sequence, which enhances the interactions of CagL with integrins. It will be referred to as RGD helper sequence (RHS). Competitive cell adhesion assays with recombinant wild type CagL and point mutants, competition experiments with synthetic cyclic and linear peptides, and peptide array experiments revealed amino acids essential for the interaction of the RHS motif with integrins. Infection experiments indicate that the RHS motif plays a role in the early interaction of H. pylori T4SS with integrin, to trigger signaling and to inject CagA into host cells. We thus postulate that CagL is a versatile T4SS surface protein equipped with at least two motifs to promote binding to integrins, thereby causing aberrant signaling within host cells and facilitating translocation of CagA into host cells, thus contributing directly to H. pylori pathogenesis.},

Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection has been established as a major risk factor for GC. Although more than 50\% of the world population is infected with this bacterium, less than 2\% develop GC. Therefore, further risk factors (such as host genetic polymorphisms and lifestyle, as well as environmental and epigenetic factors) may also play a role in its occurrence. The correlation between HP infection and GC represents a typical model of a multi-step process, characterized by some pre-neoplastic lesions with a high risk of progression (atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia). In addition, HP also plays an oncogenic role in the development of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, that accounts for approximately 3\% of all gastric tumors. Hyperplastic polyps often arise in patients with atrophic gastric mucosa and HP-associated gastritis (25\% of cases); however, their malignant transformation is rare ({$<$}3\% of cases). A number of trials have demonstrated the possibility of cancer prevention through HP screening and eradication, particularly in high-risk populations, whereas it may not be cost-effective in areas of low risk. In this review, we discuss i) the complex pathogenetic mechanisms of gastric carcinogenesis in which HP is involved; ii) the main approaches to the diagnosis, prevention, surveillance and treatment of pre-malignant lesions associated with HP infection; iii) the most effective way to detect GC in its earlier stages; and iv) the most important contribution to reducing the burden of GC.},

Mucin-type O-linked oligosaccharides were directly released by reductive beta-elimination from gastric biopsies from rhesus monkeys. The released oligosaccharides were structurally characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionozation and electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. A diverse profile of neutral and acidic oligosaccharides was observed with these techniques. The most predominant core structure detected in all of the samples at relatively high abundance corresponded to core 2 (2HexNAc-1Hex, m/z = 611.227). The spectra generated from H. pylori-infected monkey samples showed fewer oligosaccharides collectively. Peaks corresponding to 1HexNAc-1Hex (m/z = 408.148) and 2HexNAc (m/z = 449.174), which most likely represent core structures, were absent in all infected monkeys studied, although present in all uninfected monkeys. Unsupervised cluster analysis demonstrated clear differences between the peaks detected in uninfected and naturally infected monkey samples. The results suggest that H. pylori infection is associated with lower relative abundance of oligosaccharides and loss of mucin-type core structures. This method can be applied to characterize the glycans associated with the mucin lining of live animals and allows for repeated analysis of the same animal over the course of infection.},

Many develop their regulatory activity in the thymus, but there is also evidence for development of Foxp3(+) T reg cells from naive precursors in the periphery. Recent studies have shown that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta can promote T reg cell development in culture, but little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate this pathway under more physiological conditions. Here, we show that after antigen activation in the intestine, naive T cells acquire expression of Foxp3. Moreover, we identify a population of CD103(+) mesenteric lymph node dendritic cells (DCs) that induce the development of Foxp3(+) T reg cells. Importantly, promotion of T reg cell responses by CD103(+) DCs is dependent on TGF-beta and the dietary metabolite, retinoic acid (RA). These results newly identify RA as a cofactor in T reg cell generation, providing a mechanism via which functionally specialized gut-associated lymphoid tissue DCs can extend the repertoire of T reg cells focused on the intestine.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that absence of the IL-12p40 subunit is more detrimental to the generation of protective responses than is the absence of the p35 subunit. To determine whether this is the case in tuberculosis, both p35 and p40 knockout mice were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mice lacking the p40 subunit were highly susceptible to increased bacterial growth, exhibited reduced production of IFN-gamma, and had increased mortality. In contrast, mice lacking the p35 subunit exhibited a moderate ability to control bacterial growth, were able to generate Ag-specific IFN-gamma responses, and survived infection longer. The superior Ag-specific responses of the p35 gene-disrupted mice, when compared with the p40 gene-disrupted mice, suggest that the p40 subunit may act other than as a component of IL-12. A candidate molecule capable of driving the protective responses in the p35 gene-disrupted mice is the novel cytokine IL-23. This cytokine is composed of the IL-12 p40 subunit and a p19 subunit. In support of a role for this cytokine in protective responses to M. tuberculosis, we determined that the p19 subunit is induced in the lungs of infected mice.},

  abstract = {The recent discoveries of the two interleukin (IL)-12-related cytokines, IL-23 and IL-27, reveal that the regulation of cellular immunity is more complex than originally thought. Until these discoveries, the role of IL-12 in modulating cellular immune responses had been overestimated due to the belief that the IL-12 p40 subunit was unique to IL-12. However, because p40 is shared between IL-12 and IL-23, it would be expected that p40(-/-) mice are doubly deficient in IL-12 and IL-23. Indeed, the essential role previously attributed to IL-12 in experimental autoimmune encephalitis during studies of p40(-/-) mice has been shown to be due to IL-23 instead. The newest addition to the IL-12 cytokine family, IL-27, has unique features as well. Its specific action on naive CD4+ T cells in both mice and humans appears to distinguish it from the other IL-12 family members. Although related, the IL-12 family of cytokines and their receptors have distinct patterns of expression and unique effects on developing immune responses. This review summarises much of the pertinent literature on the IL-12 cytokine family and provides predictions regarding their potential therapeutic roles based on what has been learned about their functions in vitro and in vivo in gene-deficient mice.},

Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between microbiota changes and GLP-1 secretion. A prospective case-control study with a Helicobacter pylori-positive patient model involving subjects under eradication therapy (omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin). Forty patients with H. pylori infection and 20 matched participants, but negative for H. pylori antigen. Patients were evaluated before and two months after treatment. We analyzed anthropometric measurements, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid profile, and C-reactive protein. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing (IlluminaMiSeq). Eradication treatment for H. pylori decreased bacterial richness (Chao1, p = 0.041). Changes in gut microbiota profiles were observed at phylum, family, genus and species levels. GLP-1 secretion and variables of carbohydrate metabolism were improved. Correlations were seen between GLP-1 changes and variations within microbial community abundances, specifically Bifidobacterium adolescentis, the Lachnobacterium genus, and Coriobacteriaceae family. A conventional treatment to eradicate H. pylori could improve carbohydrate metabolism possibly in relation with an increase in GLP-1 secretion. GLP-1 secretion may be related to alterations in intestinal microbiota, specifically Lachnobacterium, B. adolescentis and Coriobacteriaceae.},

OBJECTIVE: Study of the relationship between human IL-17A-producing CD4(+) T(H) cells (T(H)17) and IL-4-producing CD4(+) T(H) (T(H)2) cells. METHODS: T-cell clones generated from the CCR6(+)CD161(+) fraction of human circulating CD4(+) T cells, which contains virtually all T(H)17 cells, as well as circulating CD4(+) T cells from both healthy subjects and patients with asthma, were assessed by flow cytometry for their cytokine production profile. RESULTS: A small proportion of CCR6(+)CD161(+)CD4(+) T-cell clones showed the ability to produce both IL-17A and IL-4 (T(H)17/T(H)2). T(H)17/T(H)2 clones also produced IL-5, IL-8, IL-9, IL-13, IL-21, and IL-22 and displayed the ability to induce the in vitro secretion of IgE. A very few T(H)17/T(H)2 cells were found among circulating CD4(+) T cells from normal subjects, but their proportions were significantly increased in the circulation of patients with chronic asthma. T(H)17/T(H)2 cells could not be derived from naive umbilical cord blood CD4(+) T cells under any experimental condition. However, when circulating memory CCR6(+)CD161(+)CD4(+) T cells were cloned under appropriate polarizing conditions, T(H)17/T(H)2 clones originated in the presence of IL-4, suggesting that an IL-4-rich microenvironment may induce the shifting of memory T(H)17 cells into T(H)17/T(H)2 cells. CONCLUSION: Because of its peculiar functional properties and the increased numbers in the circulation of patients with bronchial asthma, this previously unknown population of T(H)17/T(H)2 cells may play some role in the pathogenesis of this disease.},

Th1 cells, thank to IFN-{$\gamma$} production, are responsible for cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens, Th2 cells, through the production of IL-4, provide some degree of protection against helminthes, and Th17 cells, via IL-17, promote neutrophils recruitment for the clearance of bacteria and fungi. However, beyond their protective role, these T-helper subsets can also be involved in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases. Asthma is an inflammatory disease characterized by different clinical phenotypes. Allergic asthma is the result of an inflammatory process driven by allergen-specific Th2 lymphocytes, whereas Th17 cells are mainly involved in those forms of asthma, where neutrophils more than eosinophils, contribute to the inflammation. The identification in allergic asthma of Th17/Th2 cells, able to produce both IL-4 and IL-17, is in keeping with the observation that different clinical phenotypes can coexist in the same patient. In conclusion, a picture in which different T-cell subpopulations are active in different phase of bronchial asthma is emerging, and the wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes is probably the expression of different cellular characters playing a role in lung inflammation.},

We developed and evaluated a digital method for quantifying B and T lymphocytes in whole minor salivary gland biopsy slides. METHODS: Minor salivary gland biopsies were immunostained with anti-CD20/anti-CD3 antibodies using red/brown chromogens. Slides were digitised and spliced into mosaics of smaller JPEG format images in which red and brown pixels were counted. ImageJ Cell counter was used for validation. Agreement between the digital and manual methods was evaluated using Bland-Altman plots and the interclass correlation coefficient. External validation relied on the Chisholm-Mason, Tarpley, and focus-score methods. RESULTS: Of 62 minor salivary gland biopsy slides, 61.3~\% had a Chisholm-Mason grade\,{$\geq$}\,III or a focus score {$\geq$}1. The number of pixels correlated well with manual cell counts (r\,=\,0.95 for red pixels vs. B cell count and r\,=\,0.91 for brown pixels vs. T cell count). Interclass correlation coefficients between digital and manual counts were excellent (0.92 for B/T cells). B-cell proportion showed a significant positive correlation with the focus score (Spearman's coefficient 0.463, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Median B-cell proportion was lower in minor salivary gland biopsies with Chisholm grades I-II (2.5~\% (0.2-13.9)) than III-IV (30.0~\% (15.5-45.2)) and increased with Tarpley's class (1, 2.2~\% (0.2-6.6); 2, 27.2~\% (13.0-38.9); and 3-4, 48.5~\% (29.4-56.4); p\,{$<$}\,0.001 for all comparisons). Minor salivary gland biopsy B-cell proportion was also significantly correlated with several markers of clinical and biological activity of the disease, especially with markers of systemic B-cell hyperactivation. CONCLUSION: The digital procedure proved accurate compared to the reference standard, producing reliable results for whole tissue sections. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov [ NCT00740948 ].

Type I intestinal metaplasia was found in 133 patients (98.5\%), type II in 106 patients (78.5\%) and type III in 21 patients (15.6\%). Ninety eight of these 135 patients (72.6\%) were H pylori positive and 37 patients (27.4\%) were H pylori negative. No statistically significant difference was found in the prevalence of type I and II intestinal metaplasia between the intestinal metaplasia positive and H pylori positive and intestinal metaplasia negative and H pylori negative patients. Type III intestinal metaplasia was found less often in the intestinal metaplasia positive and H pylori positive patients (11.2\%) as compared with intestinal metaplasia positive and H pylori negative patients (27\%) (p less than 0.05). In contrast with type I and II intestinal metaplasia type III intestinal metaplasia was found more often in moderate/severe intestinal metaplasia than in mild intestinal metaplasia (p less than 0.02). Within the group of patients with moderate/severe intestinal metaplasia, type III was found less often in the H pylori positive patients (p less than 0.05). We suggest that the gastric milieu for H pylori is less appropriate in type III intestinal metaplasia positive patients. As type III intestinal metaplasia might be regarded as a marker of possibly increased gastric cancer risk, the lower prevalence of H pylori in these type III intestinal metaplasia positive patients might be the result of severe changes in mucosal architecture.},

  abstract = {IL-27 is formed by the association of a cytokine subunit, p28, with the soluble cytokine receptor EBV-induced gene 3 (EBI3). The IL-27R comprises gp130 and WSX-1. The marked difference between EBI3-/- and WSX-1-/- mice suggests that p28 has functions independent of EBI3. We have identified an alternative secreted complex formed by p28 and the soluble cytokine receptor cytokine-like factor 1 (CLF). Like IL-27, p28/CLF is produced by dendritic cells and is biologically active on human NK cells, increasing IL-12- and IL-2-induced IFN-{$\gamma$} production and activation marker expression. Experiments with Ba/F3 transfectants indicate that p28/CLF activates cells expressing IL-6R{$\alpha$} in addition to the IL-27R subunits. When tested on CD4 and CD8 T cells, p28/CLF induces IL-6R{$\alpha$}-dependent STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, p28/CLF inhibits CD4 T cell proliferation and induces IL-17 and IL-10 secretion. These results indicate that p28/CLF may participate in the regulation of NK and T cell functions by dendritic cells. The p28/CLF complex engages IL-6R and may therefore be useful for therapeutic applications targeting cells expressing this receptor. Blocking IL-6R using humanized mAbs such as tocilizumab has been shown to be beneficial in pathologies like rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The identification of a new IL-6R ligand is therefore important for a complete understanding of the mechanism of action of this emerging class of immunosuppressors.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To use a range of natural phenotypically variant strains of Helicobacter pylori with disparate CagA and VacA (vacuolating cytotoxin) expression to determine which bacterial factors are more closely associated with epithelial interleukin-8 (IL-8) induction. METHODS: Gastric epithelial cells (AGS and KATO-3) were co-cultured with five H pylori strains which were variously shown to express the cagA gene/CagA protein, VacA and/or to exhibit biological cytotoxicity. Secreted IL-8 was assayed by enzyme leaked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and IL-8 messenger RNA (mRNA) was assayed using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction based technique (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Strains expressing CagA, including a variant strain (D931) which is non-cytotoxic and does not express the VacA protein, were found to upregulate epithelial IL-8 secretion and gene expression. In contrast, strains with no CagA expression, even in the presence of VacA and/or biological cytotoxicity, (G104, BA142), failed to induce IL-8 protein or mRNA above control values. CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly support a role for H pylori CagA or coexpressed factors other than the cytotoxin in upregulation of gastric epithelial IL-8. Increased epithelial IL-8 secretion and concomitant neutrophil chemotaxis and activation in addition to direct cytotoxicity may be an important factor in tissue damage and ulceration.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To investigate the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) in Helicobacter pylori infected normal and neoplastic gastroduodenal mucosa, and in established gastric cancer cell lines. METHODS: Immunofluorescence techniques were used to localise IL-8 in cryosections of gastric (n = 25) and duodenal (n = 17) endoscopic biopsy specimens an in resected gastric tumour tissue samples from 16 patients. Two gastric cancer cell lines (Kato 3 and MKN 45) were examined for IL-8 protein expression by immunofluorescence and for the presence of IL-8 mRNA by reverse transcription followed by the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: IL-8 was localised to the epithelium in histologically normal gastric mucosa, with particularly strong expression in the surface cells. IL-8 expression was also a feature of surface epithelium in the duodenal bulb, but was much reduced in the second part of the duodenum. In chronic H pylori-associated gastritis gastritis gastric epithelial IL-8 expression was increased and expression of IL-8 within the lamina propria was evident. By contrast, large areas of IL-8 negative epithelium were observed in the body mucosa of a subject with M\'en\'etrier's disease. In gastric carcinoma the tumour cells were positive for IL-8. IL-8 was also detected by immunofluorescence in unstimulated Kato 3 and MKN 45 cells, and constitutive IL-8 gene expression in these cell lines was confirmed by detection of IL-8 mRNA by RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Immunoreactive IL-8, a potent neutrophil chemotactic and activating factor, is present in the epithelium of both normal and inflamed gastric mucosa with increased expression in the latter. There is site dependent variation in epithelial IL-8 expression within the gastroduodenal mucosa. The expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 in gastric carcinoma cells may influence peritumoural cellular infiltrates.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To review the role of interleukin (IL)-8 in the immunopathology of Helicobacter pylori-associated gastroduodenal disease. METHOD Literature review. RESULTS In H. pylori infection, IL-8 secretion by the gastric mucosa is increased, particularly in patients with active neutrophilic gastritis. Immunoreactive IL-8 is evident in the epithelium of histologically normal gastric mucosa but epithelial IL-8 expression is increased in H. pylori-associated chronic gastritis. Gastric epithelial cell lines constitutively express IL-8 messenger (m)RNA and IL-8 message and protein secretion can be upregulated by the cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. H. pylori also directly induces epithelial IL-8 expression in a strain-specific manner. Cytotoxic strains expressing the CagA protein upregulate IL-8 mRNA and IL-8 protein secretion. CONCLUSION IL-8 is an important chemotactic and activating factor for neutrophils. The secretion of IL-8 by epithelial cells is probably a key factor in host defences at mucosal sites, permitting a rapid polymorph response against infectious agents. If defence mechanisms fail and chronic infection results, continued upregulation of IL-8 and neutrophil activation could lead to mucosal damage and increased free radical formation. Mucosal IL-8 production in H. pylori infection may be an important factor in the immunopathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease and also be of relevance to gastric carcinogenesis.},

  abstract = {Chronic gastritis is a long-lasting disease that can lead to a loss of appropriate gastric glands. Gastritis, as term, apply to an inflammation of the stomach, histologically proven, sometimes with structural mucosal changes. Worldwide Helicobacter pylori's infection play a pivotal role as the main etiological effector of chronic active gastritis. H. p. is a bacterium with a selective tropism for the gastric mucosa, able to survive in a hostile environment for colonization of organisms other than itself, able to develop strategies for survival and for avoidance of the defence mechanisms, causing inflammatory changes, that vary from asymptomatic mild gastritis to more severe injury such as peptic ulcer as well as premalignant lesions and malignant tumours. The pattern and distribution of gastritis strongly correlate with these sequelae and chronic atrophic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia is now assessed as a precancerous lesion with definite risk of evolution towards intraepithelial lesions of both low and high grade, as expected in the model of the Correa's cascade. In fact, the leading complication of chronic gastritis remains its close correlation with gastric cancer being biologically linked to H. pylori infection, nowadays known as a class I carcinogen. Gastric carcinogenesis is due to environmental factors, as well as to bacterial strain, host responses and gastric mucosal microbiome dysbiosis. Since, individual patients show different gastric cancer risk, it is mandatory to identify patients at risk of developing gastric cancer to offer a targeted search for lesions with a more rapid development of neoplasm liable, in an early phase, to a less destructive treatment. OLGA staging system is the most reliable and powerful system that allow the recognition of patient with a higher risk of developing gastric cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinicopathological studies suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology begins {$\sim$}10-15 years before the resulting cognitive impairment draws medical attention. Biomarkers that can detect AD pathology in its early stages and predict dementia onset would, therefore, be invaluable for patient care and efficient clinical trial design. We utilized a targeted proteomics approach to discover novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers that can augment the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of current leading CSF biomarkers (A{$\beta$}42, tau, p-tau181). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a multiplexed Luminex platform, 190 analytes were measured in 333 CSF samples from cognitively normal (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] 0), very mildly demented (CDR 0.5), and mildly demented (CDR 1) individuals. Mean levels of 37 analytes (12 after Bonferroni correction) were found to differ between CDR 0 and CDR{$>$}0 groups. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses revealed that small combinations of a subset of these markers (cystatin C, VEGF, TRAIL-R3, PAI-1, PP, NT-proBNP, MMP-10, MIF, GRO-{$\alpha$}, fibrinogen, FAS, eotaxin-3) enhanced the ability of the best-performing established CSF biomarker, the tau/A{$\beta$}42 ratio, to discriminate CDR{$>$}0 from CDR 0 individuals. Multiple machine learning algorithms likewise showed that the novel biomarker panels improved the diagnostic performance of the current leading biomarkers. Importantly, most of the markers that best discriminated CDR 0 from CDR{$>$}0 individuals in the more targeted ROC analyses were also identified as top predictors in the machine learning models, reconfirming their potential as biomarkers for early-stage AD. Cox proportional hazards models demonstrated that an optimal panel of markers for predicting risk of developing cognitive impairment (CDR 0 to CDR{$>$}0 conversion) consisted of calbindin, A{$\beta$}42, and age. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Using a targeted proteomic screen, we identified novel candidate biomarkers that complement the best current CSF biomarkers for distinguishing very mildly/mildly demented from cognitively normal individuals. Additionally, we identified a novel biomarker (calbindin) with significant prognostic potential.},

In this Review, we explore the many innate immune cell populations that are an early source of IL-17 in response to stress, injury or pathogens.

Helicobacter pylori, a gram-negative bacterium capable of chronic colonization of the human stomach, modifies its lipid A by removal of phosphate groups from the 1- and 4'-positions of the lipid A backbone. In this study, we identify the enzyme responsible for dephosphorylation of the lipid A 4'-phosphate group in H. pylori, Jhp1487 (LpxF). To ascertain the role these modifications play in the pathogenesis of H. pylori, we created mutants in lpxE (1-phosphatase), lpxF (4'-phosphatase) and a double lpxE/F mutant. Analysis of lipid A isolated from lpxE and lpxF mutants revealed lipid A species with a 1 or 4'-phosphate group, respectively while the double lpxE/F mutant revealed a bis-phosphorylated lipid A. Mutants lacking lpxE, lpxF, or lpxE/F show a 16, 360 and 1020 fold increase in sensitivity to the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B, respectively. Moreover, a similar loss of resistance is seen against a variety of CAMPs found in the human body including LL37, {$\beta$}-defensin 2, and P-113. Using a fluorescent derivative of polymyxin we demonstrate that, unlike wild type bacteria, polymyxin readily associates with the lpxE/F mutant. Presumably, the increase in the negative charge of H. pylori LPS allows for binding of the peptide to the bacterial surface. Interestingly, the action of LpxE and LpxF was shown to decrease recognition of Helicobacter LPS by the innate immune receptor, Toll-like Receptor 4. Furthermore, lpxE/F mutants were unable to colonize the gastric mucosa of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6J tlr4 -/- mice when compared to wild type H. pylori. Our results demonstrate that dephosphorylation of the lipid A domain of H. pylori LPS by LpxE and LpxF is key to its ability to colonize a mammalian host.},

As a result of their ability to differentiate into distinct effector lineages, CD4 T cells significantly contribute to pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses. Through the production of effector cytokines, CD4 T helper (Th) cells orchestrate the precise mobilization of specific immune cells to eradicate infection. The protective effects of the newly identified lineage of Th17 cells against pathogens like Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter rodentium and Candida albicans indicate the capacity of Th17 cells to confer protection against extracellular bacterial and fungal pathogens, filling a critical void in host immunity not covered by the classically described Th1 lineage that activates immunity to intracellular pathogens or the Th2 lineage that is important in protection against mucosal parasitic pathogens. Host defence by Th17 cells extends beyond protection against extracellular bacterial and fungal pathogens, as demonstrated in infections against intracellular bacteria like Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica, as well as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Herein, we summarize both experimental data from mouse infection models and epidemiological studies in humans that demonstrate the protective effects of interleukin-17 and Th17 CD4 T cells in immunity to bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal pathogens.},

H. pylori infection can lead to several gastric maladies, including gastric cancer, and although antimicrobial therapies for the infection exist, the cost of treatment for gastric cancer and the prognosis of individuals who present with this disease make vaccine development a cost effective alternative to bacterial eradication. Experimental mucosal and systemic H. pylori vaccines in mice significantly reduce bacterial load and sometimes provide sterilizing immunity. Clinical trials of oral vaccines consisting of H. pylori proteins with bacterial exotoxin adjuvants or live attenuated bacterial vectors expressing H. pylori proteins induce adaptive immune mechanisms but fail to consistently reduce bacterial load. Clinical trials and murine studies demonstrate that where H. pylori is killed, either spontaneously or following vaccination, the host demonstrated cellular immunity. Improved efficacy of vaccines may be achieved in new trials of vaccine formulations that include multiple antigens and use methods to optimize cellular immunity. Unfortunately, the industrial sponsors that served as the primary engine for much of the previous animal and human research have withdrawn their support. A renewed or expanded commitment from the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry that could exploit recent advances in our understanding of the host immune response to H. pylori is necessary for the advancement of an H. pylori vaccine.},

As a new approach, we evaluated the protolerogenic potential of calcitriol and dexamethasone in acute T helper (Th)1-mediated colitis in mice. A rectal enema of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) (100 mg/kg) was applied to BALB/c mice. Calcitriol and/or dexamethasone were administered i.p. from days 0 to 3 or 3 to 5 following the instillation of the haptenating agent. Assessment of colitis severity was performed daily. Colon tissue was analyzed macroscopically and microscopically, and myeloperoxidase activity, as well as cytokine levels [tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-12p70, IL-1beta, IL-10, IL-4] were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, T-bet, GATA family of transcription factors 3, a Th2 master regulator (GATA3), Foxp3, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), IL-23p19 and IL-17 expression by immunoblot analysis. The combination of the steroids most effectively reduced the clinical and histopathologic severity of TNBS colitis. Th1-related parameters were down-regulated, whereas Th2 markers like IL-4 and GATA3 were up-regulated. Apart from known steroid effects, calcitriol in particular promoted regulatory T cell profiles as indicated by a marked increase of IL-10, TGFbeta, FoxP3, and CTLA4. Furthermore, analysis of dendritic cell mediators responsible for a proinflammatory differentiation of T cells revealed a significant reduction of IL-12p70 and IL23p19 as well as IL-6 and IL-17. Thus, our data support a rationale for a steroid-sparing, clinical application of calcitriol derivatives in inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore they suggest that early markers of inflammatory dendritic cell and Th17 differentiation qualify as new target molecules for both calcitriol and highly selective immune-modulating vitamin D analogs.},

The differentiation of Th17 cells requires the simultaneous presence of an unusual combination of cytokines: IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine, and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta, an antiinflammatory cytokine. However, the molecular mechanisms by which TGF-beta exerts its effects on Th17 cell differentiation remain elusive. We report that TGF-beta does not directly promote Th17 cell differentiation but instead acts indirectly by blocking expression of the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 4 and GATA-3, thus preventing Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation. In contrast, TGF-beta had no effect on the expression of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor gammat, a Th17-specific transcription factor. Interestingly, in Stat-6(-/-)T-bet(-/-) mice, which are unable to generate Th1 and Th2 cells, IL-6 alone was sufficient to induce robust differentiation of Th17 cells, whereas TGF-beta had no effect, suggesting that TGF-beta is dispensable for Th17 cell development. Consequently, BALB/c Stat-6(-/-)T-bet(-/-) mice, but not wild-type BALB/c mice, were highly susceptible to the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which could be blocked by anti-IL-17 antibodies but not by anti-TGF-beta antibodies. Collectively, these data provide evidence that TGF-beta is not directly required for the molecular orchestration of Th17 cell differentiation.},

MALDI spectra show mostly intact singly charged ions. To obtain fragments, the activation of singly charged precursors is necessary, but not efficient above 3.5 kDa, thus making MALDI MS/MS difficult for large species. In-source decay (ISD) is a prompt fragmentation reaction that can be induced thermally or by radicals. As fragments are formed in the source, precursor ions cannot be selected; however, the technique is not limited by the mass of the analyzed compounds and pseudo MS3 can be performed on intense fragments. The discovery of new matrices that enhance the ISD yield, combined with the high sensitivity of MALDI mass spectrometers, and software development, opens new perspectives. We first review the mechanisms involved in the ISD processes, then discuss ISD applications like top-down sequencing and post-translational modifications (PTMs) studies, and finally review MALDI-ISD tissue imaging applications.},

However, its prevalence varies among different geographic areas, and is influenced by several factors. The infection can be acquired by means of oral-oral or fecal-oral transmission, and the pathogen possesses various mechanisms that improve its capacity of mobility, adherence and manipulation of the gastric microenvironment, making possible the colonization of an organ with a highly acidic lumen. In addition, H. pylori presents a large variety of virulence factors that improve its pathogenicity, of which we highlight cytotoxin associated antigen A, vacuolating cytotoxin, duodenal ulcer promoting gene A protein, outer inflammatory protein and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. The host immune system, mainly by means of a Th1-polarized response, also plays a crucial role in the infection course. Although most H. pylori-positive individuals remain asymptomatic, the infection predisposes the development of various clinical conditions as peptic ulcers, gastric adenocarcinomas and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. Invasive and non-invasive diagnostic methods, each of them with their related advantages and limitations, have been applied in H. pylori detection. Moreover, bacterial resistance to antimicrobial therapy is a major challenge in the treatment of this infection, and new therapy alternatives are being tested to improve H. pylori eradication. Last but not least, the development of effective vaccines against H. pylori infection have been the aim of several research studies.},

Here we show novel candidate housekeeping genes (e.g. RPS13, RPL27, RPS20 and OAZ1) with enhanced stability among a multitude of different cell types and varying experimental conditions. None of the commonly used housekeeping genes were present in the top 50 of the most stable expressed genes. In addition, using 2,543 diverse mouse gene array samples we were able to confirm the enhanced stability of the candidate novel housekeeping genes in another mammalian species. Therefore, the identified novel candidate housekeeping genes seem to be the most appropriate choice for normalizing gene expression data.},

Although effective antibiotic treatment exists, there is a consensus that vaccines are necessary to limit the severity of this infection. Great progress has been made since its discovery 25 years ago in understanding the virulence factors and several aspects of the pathogenesis of the H. pylori gastric diseases. Several key bacterial factors have been identified: urease, vacuolating cytotoxin, cytotoxin-associated antigen, the pathogenicity island, neutrophil-activating protein, and among others. These proteins, in their native or recombinant forms, have been shown to confer protection against infectious challenge with H. pylori in experimental animal models. It is not known, however, through which effector mechanisms this protection is achieved. Nevertheless, a number of clinical trials in healthy volunteers have been conducted using urease given orally as a soluble protein or expressed in bacterial vectors with limited results. Recently, a mixture of H. pylori antigens was reported to be highly immunogenic in H. pylori-negative volunteers following intramuscular administration of the vaccine with aluminium hydroxide as an adjuvant. These data show that vaccination against this pathogen is feasible. More research is required to understand the immunological mechanisms underlying immune-mediate protection.},

The type of host immune response against H. pylori is crucial for the outcome of the infection. A predominant H. pylori-specific Th1 response, characterized by high IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-12 production associates with peptic ulcer, whereas combined secretion of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines are present in uncomplicated gastritis. Gastric T cells from MALT lymphoma exhibit abnormal help for autologous B-cell proliferation and reduced perforin- and Fas-Fas ligand-mediated killing of B cells. In H. pylori-infected patients with autoimmune gastritis cytolytic T cells infiltrating the gastric mucosa cross-recognize different epitopes of H. pylori proteins and H+K+ ATPase autoantigen. These data suggest that peptic ulcer can be regarded as a Th1-driven immunopathological response to some H. pylori antigens, whereas deregulated and exhaustive H. pylori-induced T cell-dependent B-cell activation can support the onset of low-grade B-cell lymphoma.

  abstract = {During evolution microorganisms have developed several immune modulating strategies. The Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein (HP-NAP) is a virulence factor that attracts and activates neutrophils, and promotes their endothelial adhesion and the production of oxygen radicals and chemokines, including CXCL8, CCL3 and CCL4. HP-NAP, a TLR2 agonist, is an immune modulator able to induce the expression of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-23 by human neutrophils and monocytes. In fact, HP-NAP has the potential to shift antigen-specific T-cell responses from a predominant Th2 to a polarized Th1 cytotoxic phenotype, characterized by high levels of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production. Thus, HP-NAP is a key factor driving Th1 inflammation in H. pylori infection and may be a new tool for future therapeutic strategies aimed at redirecting Th2 into Th1 responses, for example in atopy, vaccinology and cancer immunotherapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Vaccine efficacy against gastric Helicobacter pylori infection has been shown in mice, but little is known about the mechanisms of bacterial clearance. Our aim was to investigate a possible T-cell/neutrophil pathway of vaccine-induced protection. METHODS: Nonimmune and immunized mice were compared for their response to H pylori challenge. T-cell responses were assessed by recall assays. Interleukin (IL)-17-induced chemokine production was evaluated by cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In a kinetic study, biopsy specimens were collected at multiple time points postchallenge and assessed for bacterial load and inflammation. Relative levels of T cells, IL-17, interferon gamma, MIP-2, KC, and LIX were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The role of neutrophils was evaluated by antibody-mediated depletion of neutrophils following challenge. RESULTS: Immunization induced strong interferon gamma- and IL-17-producing T-cell responses, and IL-17 was capable of inducing significant amounts of KC and MIP-2 from dendritic cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, and gastric epithelial cells. Challenge of immunized mice induced significantly greater gastritis than that of infected mice, preceding significantly lower bacterial loads by day 7. In immune mice, T-cell recruitment to the gastric mucosa correlated with a continuous rise in IL-17 and interferon gamma levels, followed by KC, MIP-2, and LIX production and the recruitment of significant numbers of neutrophils by day 5. Antibody-mediated depletion of neutrophils abrogated vaccine efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination of mice against H pylori results in a significant Th-17 cell recall response associated with increases in chemokines that attract neutrophils to the stomach, which are important for eradication of H pylori.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram negative bacterium that can cause diseases such as peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. IL-17A, a proinflammatory cytokine that can induce the production of CXC chemokines for neutrophil recruitment, has recently been shown to be elevated in both H. pylori-infected patients and mice. Furthermore, studies in mouse models of vaccination have reported levels significantly increased over infected, unimmunized mice and blocking of IL-17A during the challenge phase in immunized mice reduces protective immunity. Because many aspects of immunity had redundant or compensatory mechanisms, we investigated whether mice could be protectively immunized when IL-17A function is absent during the entire immune response using IL-17A and IL-17A receptor knockout (KO) mice immunized against H. pylori. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gastric biopsies were harvested from na\"ive, unimmunized/challenged, and immunized/challenged wild type (WT) and KO mice and analyzed for inflammation, neutrophil, and bacterial levels. Groups of IL-17A KO mice were also treated with anti-IFN{$\gamma$} or control antibodies. RESULTS: Surprisingly, all groups of immunized KO mice reduced their bacterial loads comparably to WT mice. The gastric neutrophil counts did not vary significantly between IL-17A KO and WT mice, whereas IL-17RA KO mice had on average a four-fold decrease compared to WT. Additionally, we performed an immunization study with CXCR2 KO mice and observed significant gastric neutrophils and reduction in bacterial load. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that there are compensatory mechanisms for protection against H. pylori and for neutrophil recruitment in the absence of an IL-17A-CXC chemokine pathway.},

Among infection-related neoplasms, cancers of the stomach, liver and cervix uteri detain the highest incidence figures, and are known to be largely attributable to Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B and C viruses, and human papilloma virus, respectively. Other infectious organisms can also cause cancer; these include the Epstein-Barr virus (nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and different types of lymphoma), Human herpes virus-8 (Kaposi's Sarcoma), human T-cell leukemia virus type I (leukaemia, lymphoma), liver flukes (cholangiocarcinoma) and schistosomiasis (bladder cancer). Infection with human immunodeficiency virus, although strongly associated with an excess of cancer incidence at many cancer sites, is probably not carcinogenic per se, but acts mainly via immunodeficiency. The burden of infection-related cancers is still underestimated worldwide, due to the use of conservative population prevalence and risk ratio estimates. Furthermore, associations with new infectious agents remain yet to be explored.},

As with gene expression profiling using microarrays, data from such experiments needs effective analysis methods to produce reliable and high-quality results. In the pre-processing of the data, one crucial analysis step is normalization, which aims to reduce measurement errors and technical variability among arrays that might have arisen during the execution of the experiments. However, there are currently a number of different approaches to choose among and an unsuitable applied method may induce misleading effects, which could affect the subsequent analysis steps and thereby any conclusions drawn from the results. The choice of normalization method is hence an important issue to consider. In this study we present the comparison of a number of data-driven normalization methods for TaqMan low-density arrays for qPCR and different descriptive statistical techniques that can facilitate the choice of normalization method. The performance of the normalization methods was assessed and compared against each other as well as against standard normalization using endogenous controls. The results clearly show that the data-driven methods reduce variation and represent robust alternatives to using endogenous controls.},

  abstract = {IL-12 is a heterodimeric lymphokine that induces IFN-gamma production by resting PBMC, enhances the lytic activity of NK/lymphokine activated killer cells, and causes the proliferation of activated T cells and NK cells. In this report, we have investigated the expression of IL-12R on mitogen- and IL-2-activated PBMC or tonsillar lymphocytes as well as on a variety of cell lines. The results of radiolabeled IL-12-binding assays indicated that high affinity IL-12R are present on PBMC activated by various T cell mitogens or by IL-2. High affinity IL-12R were also found to be expressed constitutively on a transformed marmoset NK-like cell line HVS.SILVA 40. At the time of peak IL-12R expression, mitogen- or IL-2-activated cells displayed approximately 1000 to 9000 IL-12 binding sites/cell with an apparent Kd of 100 to 900 pM. Kinetic studies revealed that maximum expression of IL-12R occurred earlier on PHA-activated PBMC as compared with PBMC activated by IL-2, and that expression of IL-12R on these cells correlated with their ability to proliferate in response to IL-12. Although IL-2 could up-regulate IL-12R expression on resting PBMC, the ability of mitogen-activated PBMC to up-regulate IL-12R was found to be independent of IL-2. Analysis of IL-12R expression by flow cytometry revealed that receptors for IL-12 are present on activated T cells of both the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets and on activated CD56+ NK cells. In contrast, neither resting PBMC or tonsillar B cells nor tonsillar B cells activated by anti-IgM/Dx, anti-IgM/Dx + IL-2, or SAC + IL-2 displayed IL-12R detectable by flow cytometry or by the radiolabeled IL-12-binding assay. In summary, these results indicate that activation of T cells or NK cells results in up-regulation of IL-12R expression; on the other hand, B cell activation, at least under some circumstances, appears not to be associated with enhanced expression of IL-12R.},

Coimmunoprecipitations from lysates and culture media of cells transfected with expression vectors for EBI3 and/or the p35 subunit of IL-12 now reveal a specific association of EBI3 with p35. Coexpression of EBI3 and p35 mutually facilitates their secretion. Most importantly, a large fraction of p35 in extracts of the trophoblast component of a human full-term normal placenta specifically coimmunoprecipitated with EBI3, indicating that EBI3 is in a heterodimer with p35, in vivo. Because EBI3 is expressed in EBV-transformed B lymphocytes, tonsil, spleen, and placental trophoblasts, the EBI3/p35 heterodimer is likely to be an important immunomodulator.},

Therefore, trophoblasts are thought to play a key role in maternal tolerance to the semiallogeneic fetus, in part through cytokine production and NK cell interaction. Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) encodes a soluble hematopoietin receptor related to the p40 subunit of interleukin-12. Previous studies indicated that EBI3 is expressed in the spleen and tonsils, and at high levels in full-term placenta. To investigate further EBI3 expression throughout human pregnancy, we generated monoclonal antibodies specific for EBI3 and developed an EBI3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunohistochemical experiments with EBI3 monoclonal antibody on first-, second-, and third-trimester placental tissues demonstrated that EBI3 was expressed throughout pregnancy by syncytiotrophoblasts and extravillous trophoblasts (cytotrophoblast cell columns, interstitial trophoblasts, multinucleated giant cells, and trophoblasts of the chorion laeve). EBI3 expression was also induced during in vitro differentiation of trophoblast cell lines. In addition, large amounts of secreted EBI3 were detected in explant cultures from first-trimester and term placentae. Consistent with these data, EBI3 levels were strongly up-regulated in sera from pregnant women and gradually increased with gestational age. These data, together with the finding that EBI3 peptide is presented by HLA-G, suggest that EBI3 is an important immunomodulator in the fetal-maternal relationship, possibly involved in NK cell regulation.},

This gene, which we have designated EBV-induced gene 3 (EBI3), encodes a 34-kDa glycoprotein which lacks a membrane-anchoring motif and is secreted. Despite the absence of a membrane-anchoring motif and of cysteines likely to mediate covalent linkage to an integral membrane protein, EBI3 is also present on the plasma membrane of EBV-transformed B lymphocytes and of transfected cells. Most newly synthesized EBI3 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum in an endoglycosidase H-sensitive form associated with the molecular chaperone calnexin and with a novel 60-kDa protein. EBI3 is expressed in vivo by scattered cells in interfollicular zones of tonsil tissue, by cells associated with sinusoids in perifollicular areas of spleen tissue, and at very high levels by placental syncytiotrophoblasts. EBI3 expression in vitro is induced in EBV-negative cell lines by expression of the EBV latent infection membrane protein-1 and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by pokeweed mitogen stimulation. EBI3 maps to chromosome 19p13.2/3, near genes encoding the erythropoietin receptor and the cytokine receptor-associated kinase, Tyk2. EBI3 synthesis by trophoblasts and by EBV-transformed cells and similarities to interleukin-12 p40 are compatible with a role for EBI3 in regulating cell-mediated immune responses.},

All cs-mucin family members have structural features that enable them to act as a releasable decoy barrier to mucosal pathogens, by providing ligands for pathogen binding and the ability to shed the bound extracellular domain. Due to the towering structure of cs-mucins at the surface, binding of mucosal pathogens can also sterically block binding to underlying cellular receptors. The cytoplasmic tail domain of cs-mucins are capable of initiating signal transduction cascades and due to their conservation across species, may play an important biological role in cellular signaling. MUC1 is one of the most extensively studied of the cs-mucin family. With respect to its physiological function in the mucosal environment, MUC1 has been demonstrated to play a dynamic role in protection of the host from infection by a wide variety of pathogens and to regulate inflammatory responses to infection. This review briefly summarizes the current knowledge and new findings regarding the structural features relating to the function of MUC1, its role as a protective barrier against pathogen invasion and mechanisms by which this cs-mucin regulates inflammation.},

Opposing this conventional dogma, this study reveals a much higher level of WSX1 expression in multiple types of epithelial tumor cells when compared with normal epithelial cells. Expression of exogenous WSX1 in epithelial tumor cells suppresses tumorigenicity in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Different from the role of WSX1 in immune cells, the antitumor activity of WSX1 in epithelial tumor cells is independent of IL-27 signaling but is mainly dependent on natural killer (NK) cell surveillance. Deficiency of either the IL-27 subunit EBV-induced gene 3 or the IL-27 receptor WSX1 in the host animals had no effect on tumor growth inhibition induced by WSX1 expression in tumor cells. Expression of WSX1 in epithelial tumor cells enhances NK cell cytolytic activity against tumor cells, whereas the absence of functional NK cells impairs the WSX1-mediated inhibition of epithelial tumor growth. The underlying mechanism by which WSX1 expression in tumor cells enhances NK cytolytic activity is dependent on up-regulation of NKG2D ligand expression. Our results reveal an IL-27-independent function of WSX1: sensitizing NK cell-mediated antitumor surveillance via a NKG2D-dependent mechanism.},

  abstract = {The role of the Th17 cell inhibiting cytokine IL-27 in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is contradictory. Its effects on the intestinal barrier have so far not been investigated, which was the aim of this study. We show that intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) express both IL-27 receptor subunits IL-27RA and gp130. The IL-27 receptor expression is up-regulated in intestinal inflammation and during bacterial infection. IL-27 activates ERK and p38 MAPKs as well as Akt, STAT1, STAT3, and STAT6 in IEC. IL-27 significantly enhances cell proliferation and IEC restitution. These functions of IL-27 are dependent on the activation of STAT3 and STAT6 signaling pathways. As analyzed by microarray, IL-27 modulates the expression of 428 target genes in IEC (316 up and 112 down; p{$<$}0.05). IL-27 as well as its main target genes are up-regulated in colonic tissue and IEC isolated from mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. The IL-27-induced expression of the anti-bacterial gene deleted in malignant brain tumor 1 (DMBT1) is mediated by p38 and STAT3 signaling, whereas the activation of the anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial gene indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) is dependent on STAT1 signal transduction. IL-27-induced indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase enzymatic activity leads to growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria by causing local tryptophan depletion. For the first time, we characterize IL-27 as a mediator of intestinal epithelial barrier protection mediated via transcriptional activation of anti-inflammatory and antibacterial target genes.},

Mice deficient in IL-18 have suppressed IFN-gamma production despite the presence of IL-12. IL-18 is related to the IL-1 family in terms of both structure and function. In terms of structure, IL-18 and IL-1beta share significant primary amino acid sequences and are similarly folded as all-beta pleated sheet molecules. Also similar to IL-1beta, IL-18 is synthesized as a biologically inactive precursor molecule lacking a signal peptide. Studies have shown that similar to the IL-1beta precursor, the IL-18 precursor requires cleavage into an active, mature molecule by the intracellular cysteine protease called IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE), which is also known as caspase-1. Therefore inhibitors of ICE activity may limit the biologic activity of IL-18 and may be useful as TH1 immunosuppressive agents. The activity of mature IL-18 is closely related to that of IL-1. IL-18 induces gene expression and synthesis of TNF, IL-1, Fas ligand, and several chemokines. The activity of IL-18 is by means of a signaling chain of a putative IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) complex. This IL-18R complex is made up of a binding chain termed IL-18Ralpha, a member of the IL-lR family previously identified as the IL-1R-related protein (IL-1Rrp), and a signaling chain, the IL-18Rbeta, also a member of the IL-1R family. The IL-18R complex recruits IL-1R-activating kinase and TNF receptor-associated factor-6, which phosphorylates nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB)-inducing kinase with subsequent activation of NFkappaB. Thus on the basis of primary structure, 3-dimensional structure, receptor family, signal transduction pathways, and biologic effects of IL-18 appear to place this cytokine in the IL-1 family.

Th1 immunity has also been demonstrated to play a role in the protective immune response and can compensate in the absence of IL-17. To further address the potential of Th1 immunity, we investigated the efficacy of immunization in mice deficient in IL-23p19, a cytokine that promotes Th17 cell development. We also examined the course of Helicobacter infection in unimmunized mice treated with Th1 promoting cytokine IL-12. C57BL/6, IL-12 p35 KO, and IL-23 p19 KO mice were immunized and challenged with H. pylori. Protective immunity was evaluated by CFU determination and QPCR on gastric biopsies. Gastric and splenic IL-17 and IFN{$\gamma$} levels were determined by PCR or by ELISA. Balb/c mice were infected with H. felis and treated with IL-12 therapy and the resulting gastric bacterial load and inflammatory response were assessed by histologic evaluation. Vaccine induced reductions in bacterial load that were comparable to wild type mice were observed in both IL-12 p35 and IL-23 p19 KO mice. In the absence of IL-23 p19, IL-17 levels remained low but IFN{$\gamma$} levels increased significantly in both immunized challenged and unimmunized/challenged mice. Additionally, treatment of H. felis-infected Balb/c mice with IL-12 resulted in increased gastric inflammation and the eradication of bacteria in most mice. These data suggest that Th1 immunity can compensate for the lack of IL-23 mediated Th17 responses, and that protective Th1 immunity can be induced in the absence of immunization through cytokine therapy of the infected host.},

We examined the molecular mechanism by which IL-27 regulates TGFbeta plus IL-6- or IL-23-dependent Th17 development in the mouse and human systems. IL-27 inhibited the production of IL-17A and IL-17F in naive T cells by suppressing, in a STAT1-dependent manner, the expression of the Th17-specific transcription factor RORgamma t. The in vivo significance of the role of IL-27 was addressed in delayed-type hypersensitivity response and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). By generating mice deficient for the p28 subunit of IL-27, we showed that IL-27 regulated the severity of delayed-type hypersensitivity response and EAE through its effects on Th17 cells. Furthermore, up-regulation of IL-10 in the CNS, which usually occurs late after EAE onset and plays a role in the resolution of the disease, was notably absent in IL-27p28(-/-) mice. These results show that IL-27 acts as a negative regulator of the developing IL-17A response in vivo, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for IL-27 in autoimmune diseases.},

To reappraise the Sydney System 4 years after its introduction, a group of gastrointestinal pathologists from various parts of the world met in Houston, Texas, in September 1994. The aims of the workshop were (a) to establish an agreed terminology of gastritis; (b) to identify, define, and attempt to resolve some of the problems associated with the Sydney System. This article introduces the Sydney System as it was revised at the Houston Gastritis Workshop and represents the consensus of the participants. Overall, the principles and grading of the Sydney System were only slightly modified, the grading being aided by the provision of a visual analogue scale. The terminology of the final classification has been improved to emphasize the distinction between the atrophic and nonatrophic stomach; the names used for each entity were selected because they are generally acceptable to both pathologists and gastroenterologists. In addition to the main categories and atrophic and nonatrophic gastritis, the special or distinctive forms are described and their respective diagnostic criteria are provided. The article includes practical guidelines for optimal biopsy sampling of the stomach, for the use of the visual analogue scales for grading the histopathologic features, and for the formulation of a comprehensive standardized diagnosis.

Everyone who is colonized with these pathogenic bacteria can develop gastric inflammation, termed gastritis. Additionally, a small proportion of colonized people develop more adverse outcomes, including gastric ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, or gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. The development of these adverse outcomes is dependent on the establishment of a chronic inflammatory response. The development and control of this chronic inflammatory response are significantly impacted by CD4+ T helper cell activity. Noteworthy, T helper 17 (Th17) cells, a proinflammatory subset of CD4+ T cells, produce several proinflammatory cytokines that activate innate immune cell antimicrobial activity, drive a pathogenic immune response, regulate B cell responses, and participate in wound healing. Therefore, this review was written to take an intricate look at the involvement of Th17 cells and their affiliated cytokines (interleukin-17A [IL-17A], IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-26) in regulating the immune response to H. pylori colonization and carcinogenesis.},

The aim of this study was to identify the differences in gene expression profiles analyzing a panel of candidate genes in the mucosa from patients with active CD (CD-A), patients in remission (CD-R), and normal controls. PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine individuals were enrolled in the study: six CD patients (three with active lesions, three with mucosal healing) and three controls without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) seen on endoscopy. All the individuals underwent mucosal biopsy during colonoscopy. Gene expression levels of 84 genes previously associated with CD were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array. RESULTS: Ten genes out of 84 were found significantly differentially expressed in CD-A (CCL11, CCL25, DEFA5, GCG, IL17A, LCN2, REG1A, STAT3, MUC1, CCR1) and eight genes in CD-R (CASP1, IL23A, STAT1, STAT3, TNF, CCR1, CCL5, and HSP90B1) when compared to controls. A quantitative gene expression analysis revealed that CCR1 gene was more expressed in CD-A than in CD-R. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that CCR1 gene may be a putative marker of molecular activity of Crohn's disease. Following these preliminary data, a confirmation in larger cohort studies could represent a useful method in order to identify new therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori colonises the gastric mucosa of humans. The majority of organisms live in mucus. These organisms are an important reservoir for infection of the underlying epithelium. Cell culture models for H. pylori infection do not normally possess a mucus layer. The interaction of H. pylori with TFF1, a member of the trefoil factor family found in gastric mucin, is mediated by lipopolysaccharide. To test the hypothesis that the interaction of H. pylori with TFF1 promotes mucus colonization we characterised the interaction of H. pylori with a mucus secreting cell line, HT29-MTX-E12. An isogenic mutant of H. pylori with truncated core oligosaccharides was produced and binding to TFF1 and ability to colonise HT29-MTX-E12 cells determined. The adherent mucus layer of HT29-MTX-E12 cells contained the gastric mucin MUC5AC and trefoil factors, TFF1 and TFF3. H. pylori was found within the mucus layer in discrete clusters and in close association with TFF1. It also interacted with the membrane bound mucin MUC1 and replicated when co-cultured with the cells. An isogenic mutant of H. pylori with a truncated LPS core did not interact with TFF1, and colonization of HT29-MTX-E12 cells was reduced compared to the wild-type strain (p{$<$}0.05). Preincubation of cells with wild type LPS but not with truncated LPS resulted in reduced colonization by H. pylori. These results demonstrate that the interaction of TFF1 with H. pylori is important for colonization of gastric mucus and the core oligosaccharide of H. pylori LPS is critical for this interaction to occur. HT29-MTX-E12 cells are a useful system with which to study the interaction of bacteria with mucosal surfaces and the effect of such interactions on mediating colonization.},

  abstract = {In\textasciitilde [1] a cluster algorithm for graphs was introduced called the Markov cluster algorithm or MCL\textasciitilde algorithm. The algorithm is based on simulation of (stochastic) flow in graphs by means of alternation of two operators, expansion and inflation. The results in\textasciitilde [2] establish an intrinsic relationship between the corresponding algebraic process (MCL\textasciitilde process) and cluster structure in the iterands and the limits of the process. Several kinds of experiments conducted with the MCL\textasciitilde algorithm are described here. Test cases with varying homogeneity characteristics are used to establish some of the particular strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm. In general the algorithm performs well, except for graphs which are very homogeneous (such as weakly connected grids) and for which the natural cluster diameter (i.e. the diameter of a subgraph induced by a natural cluster) is large. This can be understood in terms of the flow characteristics of the MCL\textasciitilde algorithm and the heuristic on which the algorithm is grounded. A generic performance criterion for clusterings of weighted graphs is derived, by a stepwise refinement of a simple and appealing criterion for simple graphs. The most refined criterion uses a particular Schur convex function, several properties of which are established. A metric is defined on the space of partitions, which is useful for comparing different clusterings of the same graph. The metric is compared with the metric known as the equivalence mismatch coefficient. The performance criterion and the metric are used for the quantitative measurement of experiments conducted with the MCL\textasciitilde algorithm on randomly generated test graphs with 10000 nodes. Scaling the MCL\textasciitilde algorithm requires a regime of pruning the stochastic matrices which need to be computed. The effect of pruning on the quality of the retrieved clusterings is also investigated. [1] A cluster algorithm for graphs.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Expression of the Helicobacter pylori outer membrane protein HopH is regulated by phase variation within a CT dinucleotide repeat motif of the hopH gene. METHODS: To investigate the importance of HopH for bacterial pathogenicity, we performed a detailed functional genomic and population-based genetic characterization of this contingency locus. RESULTS: Sequencing of hopH in H. pylori strains from 58 patients revealed that the hopH "on" genotype is linked to bacterial virulence determinants, such as the vacAs1, vacAm1, babA2, and, most strongly, cagA genotypes. hopH mutagenesis resulted in reduced bacterial adherence to gastric epithelia in vitro. Complementation of hopH in trans restored the adherence properties of hopH mutants. Although HopH has been previously linked to proinflammatory epithelial signaling, hopH mutagenesis did not alter epithelial interleukin-8 secretion in vitro. Comparative epithelial gene-expression profiling by cDNA microarrays revealed no significant differences between the wild-type-specific and hopH mutant-specific transcriptomes. By contrast, a large set of genes was differentially regulated in a cag pathogenicity island-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: An in-frame hopH gene may be linked to gastroduodenal diseases because of its association with other virulence factors or increased bacterial adherence and colonization. The strong linkage with cagA indicates that HopH may contribute to the fitness of cagA-positive strains in vivo.},

  abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has been attributed with anti-inflammatory effects in the development of pathological immune responses leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) via the induction of regulatory T cells. In agreement with previously published findings, we find that TCDD administration confers protection from EAE, however, this immuno-modulatory effect was not the consequence of de novo Treg generation, but the inhibition of Th17 cell differentiation. Systemic application of FICZ at the time of immunization also reduced EAE pathology albeit to a lesser degree than TCDD. In vitro Th17 differentiation in the presence of AhR agonists, including TCDD, promoted IL-17 and IL-22 expression, but did not induce Treg differentiation. AhR affinity influenced the amounts of IL-17 and IL-22 protein that was secreted by Th17 cells, but did not seem to affect susceptibility to EAE in vivo. Making use of conditional AhR-deficient mice, we show that the anti-inflammatory effect of TCDD depends on AhR activation in both T cells and dendritic cells, further emphasising the ability of TCDD to interfere with T effector cell differentiation in vivo. The dichotomy between the in vivo and in vitro effects of AhR reveals the complexity of the AhR pathway, which has the capacity of affecting different AhR-expressing cell types involved in mounting immune responses, thus participating in defining their outcome.},

  abstract = {Background The slaughterhouse is a central processing point for food animals and thus a source of both demographic data (age, breed, sex) and health-related data (reason for condemnation and condemned portions) that are not available through other sources. Using these data for syndromic surveillance is therefore tempting. However many possible reasons for condemnation and condemned portions exist, making the definition of relevant syndromes challenging., The objective of this study was to determine a typology of cattle with at least one portion of the carcass condemned in order to define syndromes. Multiple factor analysis (MFA) in combination with clustering methods was performed using both health-related data and demographic data. Results Analyses were performed on 381,186 cattle with at least one portion of the carcass condemned among the 1,937,917 cattle slaughtered in ten French abattoirs. Results of the MFA and clustering methods led to 12 clusters considered as stable according to year of slaughter and slaughterhouse. One cluster was specific to a disease of public health importance (cysticercosis). Two clusters were linked to the slaughtering process (fecal contamination of heart or lungs and deterioration lesions). Two clusters respectively characterized by chronic liver lesions and chronic peritonitis could be linked to diseases of economic importance to farmers. Three clusters could be linked respectively to reticulo-pericarditis, fatty liver syndrome and farmer's lung syndrome, which are related to both diseases of economic importance to farmers and herd management issues. Three clusters respectively characterized by arthritis, myopathy and Dark Firm Dry (DFD) meat could notably be linked to animal welfare issues. Finally, one cluster, characterized by bronchopneumonia, could be linked to both animal health and herd management issues. Conclusion The statistical approach of combining multiple factor analysis with cluster analysis showed its relevance for the detection of syndromes using available large and complex slaughterhouse data. The advantages of this statistical approach are to i) define groups of reasons for condemnation based on meat inspection data, ii) help grouping reasons for condemnation among a list of various possible reasons for condemnation for which a consensus among experts could be difficult to reach, iii) assign each animal to a single syndrome which allows the detection of changes in trends of syndromes to detect unusual patterns in known diseases and emergence of new diseases.},

Widely used normalizing genes include beta-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. It has, however, become clear that these and other normalizing genes can display modulated patterns of expression across tissue types and during complex cellular processes such as cell differentiation and cancer progression. Our objective was to set the basis for identifying normalizing genes that displayed stable expression during enterocytic differentiation and between healthy tissue and adenocarcinomas of the human colon. We thus identified novel potential normalizing genes using previously generated cDNA microarray data and examined the alterations of expression of two of these genes as well as seven commonly used normalizing genes during the enterocytic differentiation process and between matched pairs of resection margins and primary carcinomas of the human colon using real-time RT-PCR. We found that ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 was particularly stable in all intestinal epithelial cell extracts, thereby representing a particularly robust housekeeping reference gene for the assessment of gene expression during the human enterocytic differentiation process. On the other hand, beta-2-microglobulin generated the best score as a normalizing gene for comparing human colon primary carcinomas with their corresponding normal mucosa of the resection margin, although others were found to represent acceptable alternatives. In conclusion, we identified and characterized specific normalizing genes that should significantly improve quantitative mRNA studies related to both the differentiation process of the human intestinal epithelium and adenocarcinomas of the human colon. This approach should also be useful to validate normalizing genes in other intestinal contexts.},

The goal of this study was to investigate the immunopathogenesis of H. pylori-induced gastritis and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) in mice. C57BL/6-Prkdc(scid) mice were infected with H. pylori and reconstituted with CD4+, CD4-depleted, CD4+CD45RB(high), or CD4+CD45RB(low) splenocytes from wild-type C57BL/6 mice or with splenocytes from C57BL/6(IFN-gamma-/-) or C57BL/6(IL-10-/-) mice. Four or eight weeks after transfer, DTH to H. pylori Ags was determined by footpad injection; gastritis and bacterial colonization were quantified; and IFN-gamma secretion by splenocytes in response to H. pylori Ag was determined. Gastritis and DTH were present in recipients of unfractionated splenocytes, CD4+ splenocytes, and CD4+CD45RB(high) splenocytes, but absent in the other groups. IFN-gamma secretion in response to H. pylori Ags was correlated with gastritis, although splenocytes from all groups of mice secreted some IFN-gamma. Gastritis was most severe in recipients of splenocytes from IL-10-deficient mice, and least severe in those given IFN-gamma-deficient splenocytes. Bacterial colonization in all groups was inversely correlated with gastritis. These data indicate that 1) CD4+ T cells are both necessary and sufficient for gastritis and DTH due to H. pylori in mice; 2) high expression of CD45RB is a marker for gastritis-inducing CD4+ cells; and 3) IFN-gamma contributes to gastritis and IL-10 suppresses it, but IFN-gamma secretion alone is not sufficient to induce gastritis. The results support the assertion that H. pylori is mediated by a Th1-biased cellular immune response.},

To further define the role intestinal epithelial cells play in initiating and modulating the host response to infection with invasive bacteria, hybrid selection on high density cDNA arrays was used to characterize the mRNA expression profile of {$\sim$}4,300 genes in human intestinal epithelial cells after infection with the prototypic invasive bacteria,Salmonella. Selected findings were further evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Northern blot analysis, and protein assays. Epithelial infection withSalmonella significantly up-regulated mRNA expression of a relatively small fraction of all genes tested. Of these, several cytokines (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, inhibin A, Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3, interleukin-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-2{$\alpha$}), kinases (TKT, Eck, HEK), transcription factors (interferon regulatory factor-1), and HLA class I were the most prominent. Furthermore, the transcription factor NF-{$\kappa$}B is shown to be important for inducible mRNA expression for a broad group of genes tested. These findings expand the repertoire of known epithelial cell responses to infection with an invasive enteric pathogen. The results also show that evaluation of mRNA expression profiles by cDNA array analysis is a powerful approach to characterizing and understanding host-pathogen interactions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between Helicobacter pylori infection and upper gastrointestinal disease is well established. However, only a small fraction of H. pylori carriers develop disease, and there are great geographical differences in disease penetrance. The explanation to this enigma lies in the interaction between the bacterium and the host. H. pylori Outer Membrane Phospholipase A (OMPLA) has been suggested to play a role in the virulence of this bacterium. The aim of this study was to profile the most significant cellular pathways and biological processes affected in gastric epithelial cells during 24 h of H. pylori exposure, and to study the inflammatory response to OMPLA{$^+$} and OMPLA{$^-$} H. pylori variants. RESULTS: Interleukin-8 was the most significantly up-regulated gene and appears to play a paramount role in the epithelial cell response to H. pylori infection and in the pathological processes leading to gastric disease. MAPK and NF-kappaB cellular pathways were powerfully activated, but did not seem to explain the impressive IL-8 response. There was marked up-regulation of TP53BP2, whose corresponding protein ASPP2 may interact with H. pylori CagA and cause marked p53 suppression of apoptosis. Other regulators of apoptosis also showed abberant regulation. We also identified up-regulation of several oncogenes and down-regulation of tumor suppressor genes as early as during the first 24 h of infection. H. pylori OMPLA phase variation did not seem to influence the inflammatory epithelial cell gene response in this experiment. CONCLUSION: In whole genome analysis of the epithelial response to H. pylori exposure, IL-8 demonstrated the most marked up-regulation, and was involved in many of the most important cellular response processes to the infection. There was dysregulation of apoptosis, tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes as early as in the first 24 h of H. pylori infection, which may represent early signs of gastric tumorigenesis. OMPLA{$^+$}/{$^-$} did not affect the acute inflammatory response to H. pylori.},

  abstract = {Jak/STAT pathways influence cell-fate decisions made by differentiating na\"ive T-cells, regulate the intensity and duration of inflammatory responses and are implicated in pathogenic mechanisms of a number of chronic inflammatory diseases. Among the STATs, the STAT3 protein has emerged as an important determinant of whether the na\"ive T cell differentiates into regulatory (Treg) or an inflammatory (Th17) T cell lineage. STAT3 also has potent anti-inflammatory effects and regulates critical cellular processes such as, cell growth, apoptosis and transcription of inflammatory genes. Dysregulation of STAT3 pathway has therefore been implicated in the development of chronic inflammatory diseases, as well as, a number of malignant and neurodegenerative diseases. This review focuses on recent findings regarding the role of STAT3 in immunity, with particular emphasis on T cell lineage specification and disease etiology. New insights from animal models of uveitis, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel diseases are discussed as exemplars of critical roles that STAT3 pathways play in inflammatory diseases and on how inhibiting STAT3 can be exploited to mitigate pathogenic autoimmunity.},

Infection occurs in young children; therefore, a prophylactic vaccine would have to be administered within the first year of life, a period thought to be immunologically privileged. We investigated vaccine formulations administered by different routes to confer protective anti-H. pylori immunity in neonatal mice. Neonatal mice immunized with a single dose of vaccine in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) generated antigen-specific gamma interferon-, interleukin-2 (IL-2)-, IL-4-, and IL-5-secreting T cells in numbers similar to those in immunized adult mice, while vaccine administered to neonates in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) induced such cells in reduced numbers compared to those in adult mice. Both IFA and CFA, however, provided partial protection from a challenge with infectious H. pylori when the vaccine was administered subcutaneously. Neonatal immunized mice also had reduced bacterial loads when immunized intraperitoneally with CFA. In all cases, protection was equivalent to that achieved when adult counterparts were immunized. These studies suggest that an efficacious vaccine might be successfully administered to very young children to prevent perinatal infection of H. pylori.},

In contrast, little is known about the effect of IL-27 on already differentiated Th17 cells. A better understanding of how IL-27 regulates these cells is needed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of IL-27 in Th17 cells-associated diseases. In this study, we show that IL-27 had surprisingly little effect on committed Th17 cells, despite its expression of a functional IL-27R. Contrary to de novo differentiation of Th17 cells, IL-27 did not suppress expression of retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR)gammat or RORalpha in committed Th17 cells. Consistent with this finding, the frequency of committed Th17 cells and their cytokine secretion remained unaffected by IL-27. Both memory Th17 cells (CD4(+)CD25(-)CD62L(low)) that developed in vivo and encephalitogenic Th17 cells infiltrating the CNS of mice developing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis produced similar amounts of IL-17A when reactivated with IL-23 in the absence and presence of exogenous IL-27. Finally, IL-27 failed to suppress encephalitogenicity of Th17 cells in an adoptive transfer of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Analysis ex vivo of transferred Th17 cells in the spleen and CNS of recipient mice showed that cells retained similar phenotype irrespective of whether cells were treated or not with IL-27. Our data demonstrate that in contrast to inhibition of de novo differentiation of Th17 cells, IL-27 has little or no effect on committed Th17 cells. These findings indicate that therapeutic applications of IL-27 might have a limited efficacy in inflammatory conditions where aggressive Th17 responses have already developed.},

However, few studies have addressed the pathologists' reliability to detect the organism and to assess the degree of the related inflammatory changes. The objectives of this study were to determine the degree of agreement among the findings of four gastrointestinal pathologists in the semiquantitative evaluation of H pylori infection and gastritis. Three slides from specified areas of the stomach of 99 patients with and without H pylori infection were stained with the triple stain, coded, and examined independently by four pathologists. For each specimen, a visual analogue scale graded from 0 (absent/normal) to 5 (maximal intensity) was used to score (1) H pylori (2) neutrophils, and (3) atrophy. Data were analyzed using kappa-statistics. The kappa-coefficient for the detection of H pylori (present vs absent) was approximately .9 (excellent); for the intensity of infection, it was considerably lower on the 6-point scale (approximately .61) and improved slightly on an amalgamated 4-point scale (approximately .71). The agreement on presence or absence of neutrophils was excellent (kappa = .8) in antral biopsies and good (kappa = .67) in corpus biopsies. The kappa for the semiquantitative scoring of neutrophils was poor on the 6-point scale (approximately .43) and fair on the amalgamated scale (approximately .54). The interobserver agreement was the poorest in the evaluation of atrophy (presence, absence, categories, or group categories) with kappa coefficients varying from .08 and .29. This group of pathologists had a high level of concordance on the diagnosis of H pylori infection in any particular patient and a high index in the assessment of the intensity of infection. The agreement was less in the semiquantitative evaluation of active inflammation. When the evaluation concerned a loosely defined feature, such as atrophy, there was essentially no agreement among the pathologists. This study suggests the need for further assessments of pathologists' ability to provide reproducible diagnoses. These results also indicate that more stringent criteria for the diagnosis of "soft" histopathologic features (such as atrophy) are urgently needed.},

Serum samples were evaluated for anti-H. pylori immunoglobulin G antibody using the enzyme immunoassay (IEA) method and for H. pylori CagA and VacA antibodies with the commercially available immunoprobing Western blot kit. Ten different families participated in the study, including 10 pediatric patients and 31 household members. All patients and 28 household members (90\%) were seropositive for H. pylori antibody by IEA and Western blot tests. Overall, 17 subjects (41.4\%) were CagA positive, 14 (34.1\%) were VacA positive, 11 (26.8\%) were positive for both antibodies, and 22 (53.6\%) were negative for both antibodies. A significant association in bacterial antibody profile was found between the patient index members and all household members (Cohen's kappa and Mentel-Haenszel methods). In four families, more than 66\% of the household members harbored the same antibody profile, and in two families a completely different profile was observed. Moreover, a similar H. pylori antibody profile between the index patient and the mother was found in six families, and between the index patient and the father in two families.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori is a constituent of the human gastric microbiota. Chronic infection with H. pylori causes gastritis and predisposes to gastric carcinoma but has also been inversely linked to various allergic and chronic inflammatory conditions. In particular, large meta-analyses have documented an inverse association between H. pylori infection and the risk of developing ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. METHODS: We investigated possible protective effects of experimental H. pylori infection and of regular treatment with H. pylori extract in 2 mouse models of colitis and in mouse models of type I diabetes and multiple sclerosis. The mechanism of protection was examined in mouse strains lacking specific innate immune recognition pathways and cytokines. RESULTS: We show here that experimental infection with H. pylori and administration of regular doses of H. pylori extract both alleviate the clinical and histopathological features of dextran sodium sulfate-induced chronic colitis and of T-cell transfer-induced colitis. High resolution endoscopy of the protected animals revealed the accumulation of large amounts of colonic mucus upon H. pylori exposure, which could be attributed to transcriptional activation of the mucin 2 gene. The protection against dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis was dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome and interleukin-18 signaling. Other autoimmune diseases, i.e., experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and type I diabetes, were not controlled by H. pylori. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we propose here that the immunomodulatory activity of an ancient constituent of the gut microbiota, H. pylori, may be exploited for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

For classic parametric tests to produce accurate results, the assumptions underlying them (e.g., normality and homoscedasticity) must be satisfied. These assumptions are rarely met when analyzing real data. The use of classic parametric methods with violated assumptions can result in the inaccurate computation of p values, effect sizes, and confidence intervals. This may lead to substantive errors in the interpretation of data. Many modern robust statistical methods alleviate the problems inherent in using parametric methods with violated assumptions, yet modern methods are rarely used by researchers. The authors examine why this is the case, arguing that most researchers are unaware of the serious limitations of classic methods and are unfamiliar with modern alternatives. A range of modern robust and rank-based significance tests suitable for analyzing a wide range of designs is introduced. Practical advice on conducting modern analyses using software such as SPSS, SAS, and R is provided. The authors conclude by discussing robust effect size indices.},

T(H)17 cells can drive antigen-specific autoimmune diseases and are considered the main population of pathogenic T cells driving experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse model for multiple sclerosis. The factors that are needed for the generation of T(H)17 cells have been well characterized. However, where and how the immune system controls T(H)17 cells in vivo remains unclear. Here, by using a model of tolerance induced by CD3-specific antibody, a model of sepsis and influenza A viral infection (H1N1), we show that pro-inflammatory T(H)17 cells can be redirected to and controlled in the small intestine. T(H)17-specific IL-17A secretion induced expression of the chemokine CCL20 in the small intestine, facilitating the migration of these cells specifically to the small intestine via the CCR6/CCL20 axis. Moreover, we found that T(H)17 cells are controlled by two different mechanisms in the small intestine: first, they are eliminated via the intestinal lumen; second, pro-inflammatory T(H)17 cells simultaneously acquire a regulatory phenotype with in vitro and in vivo immune-suppressive properties (rT(H)17). These results identify mechanisms limiting T(H)17 cell pathogenicity and implicate the gastrointestinal tract as a site for control of T(H)17 cells.},

Also, there is no evidence that any of the serious outcomes of H. pylori infection such as gastric and duodenal ulcers, gastric cancer or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma could occur without prior colonization of the gastric epithelium mediated by H. pylori adhesins. H. pylori is highly adaptable, as evidenced by the fact that it can occupy a single host for decades. An important facet of this adaptability is its ability to physically interact with various types of host cells and also with host mucins and extracellular matrix proteins using a number of different adhesins displaying a variety of unique receptor specificities. Thus it is highly unlikely that any one particular H. pylori adhesin will ever be proven responsible for a particular outcome such as duodenal ulcer, MALT lymphoma, or adenocarcinoma. Also, while the search for additional H. pylori adhesins should and certainly will continue, we suggest that the scope of this effort should be expanded to include investigations into the patterns of expression and interaction between individual outer membrane proteins. Which of the numerous H. pylori outer membrane proteins (OMPs) actually function as adhesins (i.e., have receptor-binding sites) and which OMPs are simply necessary for optimal display of the adhesive OMPs? There are many other important questions about H. pylori adhesins waiting to be answered. For example, which adhesins are responsible for loose adherence to host cells and which adhesins are responsible for intimate, or membrane-to-membrane, adherence, and do these adhesins normally work in concert or in a sequential fashion? Also, is a specific type of adhesin necessary for type IV protein translocation into host cells and, if so, is adhesin expression coregulated with the effector protein export?},

Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) has emerged as a key tool in the structural analysis of oligosaccharides because of its high sensitivity, resolution, and robustness. Here, we present a strategy that uses LC-ESI-MS/MS to characterize over 200 N- and O-glycans from human saliva glycoproteins, complemented by sequential exoglycosidase treatment, to further verify the annotated glycan structures. Fragment-specific substructure diagnostic ions were collated from an extensive screen of the literature available on the detailed structural characterization of oligosaccharides and, together with other specific glycan structure feature ions derived from cross-ring and glycosidic-linkage fragmentation, were used to characterize the glycans and differentiate isomers. The availability of such annotated mass spectrometric fragmentation spectral libraries of glycan structures, together with such substructure diagnostic ions, will be key inputs for the future development of the automated elucidation of oligosaccharide structures from MS/MS data.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori may cause chronic gastritis, gastric cancer, or lymphoma. Myeloid antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are most likely involved in the induction and expression of the underlying inflammatory responses. To study the interaction of human APC subsets with H. pylori, we infected monocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), and monocyte-derived (classically activated; M1) macrophages with H. pylori and analyzed phenotypic alterations, cytokine secretion, phagocytosis, and immunostimulation. Since we detected CD163(+) (alternatively activated; M2) macrophages in gastric biopsy specimens from H. pylori-positive patients, we also included monocyte-derived M2 macrophages in the study. Upon H. pylori infection, monocytes secreted interleukin-1{$\beta$} (IL-1{$\beta$}), IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12p40 (partially secreted as IL-23) but not IL-12p70. Infected DCs became activated, as shown by the enhanced expression of CD25, CD80, CD83, PDL-1, and CCR7, and secreted IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, and IL-23. However, infection led to significantly downregulated CD209 and suppressed the constitutive secretion of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). H. pylori-infected M1 macrophages upregulated CD14 and CD32, downregulated CD11b and HLA-DR, and secreted mainly IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, and IL-23. Activation of DCs and M1 macrophages correlated with increased capacity to induce T-cell proliferation and decreased phagocytosis of dextran. M2 macrophages upregulated CD14 and CD206 and secreted IL-10 but produced less of the proinflammatory cytokines than M1 macrophages. Thus, H. pylori affects the functions of human APC subsets differently, which may influence the course and the outcome of H. pylori infection. The suppression of MIF in DCs constitutes a novel immune evasion mechanism exploited by H. pylori.},

Alternatively spliced Tlr5 transcripts were identified but it did not explain the selective expression of TLR5 on mucosal DCs. Treatment with various bacterial ligands downregulated BMDC TLR5 expression, while retinoic acid and host stromal cell-derived signals promoted TLR5 expression in a TGF-{$\beta$}-independent mechanism. Signaling through TLR5 restrained regulatory T (Treg) cell generation, and accordingly, TLR5(-/-) mice displayed increased frequencies of Foxp3(+) Treg cells in the intestinal lamina propria. Our data indicate that bacterial and host factors differentially regulate DC TLR5 expression. TLR5 signaling regulates immune responses towards the microbiota via modulation of the Treg/effector T cell balance.},

Current data indicate that galectin-3 expressed in dendritic cells (DCs) may be contributory. Th17 cells have emerged as critical inducers of tissue inflammation in autoimmune disease and important mediators of host defense against fungal pathogens, although little is known about galectin-3 involvement in Th17 development. We investigated the role of galectin-3 in the induction of Th17 immunity in galectin-3-deficient (gal3(-/-)) and gal3(+/+) mouse bone marrow-derived DCs. We demonstrate that intracellular galectin-3 negatively regulates Th17 polarization in response to the dectin-1 agonist curdlan (a {$\beta$}-glucan present on the cell wall of fungal species) and lipopolysaccharide, agents that prime DCs for Th17 differentiation. On activation of dectin-1, gal3(-/-) DCs secreted higher levels of the Th17-axis cytokine IL-23 compared with gal3(+/+) DCs and contained higher levels of activated c-Rel, an NF-{$\kappa$}B subunit that promotes IL-23 expression. Levels of active Raf-1, a kinase that participates in downstream inhibition of c-Rel binding to the IL23A promoter, were impaired in gal3(-/-) DCs. Modulation of Th17 by galectin-3 in DCs also occurred in vivo because adoptive transfer of gal3(-/-) DCs exposed to Candida albicans conferred higher Th17 responses and protection against fungal infection. We conclude that galectin-3 suppresses Th17 responses by regulating DC cytokine production.},

  abstract = {The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is one of the most genetically diverse bacteria. Recombination and DNA transfer contribute to its genetic variability and enhance host adaptation. Among the strategies described to increase genetic diversity in bacteria, DNA transfer by conjugation is one of the best characterized. Using this mechanism, a fragment of DNA from a donor cell can be transferred to a recipient, always mediated by a conjugative nucleoprotein complex, which is evolutionarily related to type IV secretion systems (T4SSs). Interestingly, the H. pylori chromosomes can encode up to four T4SSs, including the cagPAI, comB, tfs3, and tfs4 genes, some of which are known to promote chronic H. pylori infection. The T4SS encoded by the cagPAI mediates the injection of the effector protein CagA and proinflammatory signaling, and the comB system is involved in DNA uptake from the environment. However, the role of tfs3 and tfs4 is not yet clear. The presence of a functional XerD tyrosine recombinase and 5'AAAGAATG-3' border sequences as well as two putative conjugative relaxases (Rlx1 and Rlx2), a coupling protein (TraG), and a chromosomal region carrying a putative origin of transfer (oriT) suggest the existence of a DNA transfer apparatus in tfs4. Moreover, a conjugation-like DNA transfer mechanism in H. pylori has already been described in vitro, but whether this occurs in vivo is still unknown. Some extrachromosomal plasmids and phages are also present in various H. pylori strains. Genetic exchange among plasmids and chromosomes, and involved DNA mobilization events, could explain part of H. pylori's genetic diversity. Here, we review our knowledge about the possible DNA transfer mechanisms in H. pylori and its implications in bacterial adaptation to the host environment.},

AIMS: To determine the effect of drug resistance on the efficacy of first-line treatment regimens for H. pylori and identify the most efficacious treatments in the presence of drug resistance. METHODS: We searched for studies using the keywords: 'Helicobacter pylori','resistance' and 'treatment' or 'therapy'. Multilevel meta-regression models were used to determine the effect of drug resistance on treatment efficacy. RESULTS: We analysed data from 93 studies with 10,178 participants. For triple therapies, clarithromycin resistance had a greater effect on treatment efficacy than nitroimidazole resistance. Metronidazole resistance reduced efficacy by 26\% in triple therapies containing a nitroimidazole, tetracycline and bismuth, while efficacy was reduced by only 14\% when a gastric acid inhibitor was added to the regimen. Quadruple therapies containing both clarithromycin and metronidazole were the most efficacious; {$>$}80\% of H. pylori infections were consistently eradicated with these regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance was a strong predictor of efficacy across triple therapies for the eradication of H. pylori in adults. Resistance to either clarithromycin or metronidazole, but not both simultaneously, may be overcome by using quadruple therapies, especially those containing both clarithromycin and metronidazole.},

The cag-PAI in Hp 26695 consists of 27 putative genes, six of which were identified as homologues to the basic type IV secretion system represented by the Agrobacterium tumefaciens virB operon. To define the role and contribution of each of the 27 genes, we applied a precise deletion/insertion mutagenesis procedure to knock out each individual gene without causing polar effects on the expression of downstream genes. Seventeen out of 27 genes were found to be absolutely essential for translocation of CagA into host cells and 14 out of 27 for the ability of Hp fully to induce transcription of IL-8. The products of hp0524 (virD4 homologue), hp0526 and hp0540 are absolutely essential for the translocation of CagA, but not for the induction of IL-8. In contrast, the products of hp0520, hp0521, hp0534, hp0535, hp0536 and hp0543 are not necessary for either translocation of CagA or for IL-8 induction. Our data argue against a translocated IL-8-inducing effector protein encoded by the cag-PAI. We isolated a variant of Hp 26695, which spontaneously switched off its capacity for IL-8 induction and translocation of CagA, but retained the complete cag-PAI. We identified a point mutation in gene hp0532, causing a premature translational stop in the corresponding polypeptide chain, providing a putative explanation for the defect in the type IV secretion system of the spontaneous mutant.},

  abstract = {IFN-{$\beta$}, IL-27, and IL-10 have been shown to exert a range of similar immunoregulatory effects in murine and human experimental systems, particularly in Th1- and Th17-mediated models of autoimmune inflammatory disease. In this study we sought to translate some of our previous findings in murine systems to human in vitro models and delineate the interdependence of these different cytokines in their immunoregulatory effects. We demonstrate that human IL-27 upregulates IL-10 in T cell-activated PBMC cultures and that IFN-{$\beta$} drives IL-27 production in activated monocytes. IFN-{$\beta$}-driven IL-27 is responsible for the upregulation of IL-10, but not IL-17 suppression, by IFN-{$\beta$} in human PBMCs. Surprisingly, IL-10 is not required for the suppression of IL-17 by either IL-27 or IFN-{$\beta$} in this model or in de novo differentiating Th17 cells, nor is IL-27 signaling required for the suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by IFN-{$\beta$} in vivo. Furthermore, and even more surprisingly, IL-10 is not required for the suppression of Th17-biased EAE by IL-27, in sharp contrast to Th1-biased EAE. In conclusion, IFN-{$\beta$} and IL-27 both induce human IL-10, both suppress human Th17 responses, and both suppress murine EAE. However, IL-27 signaling is not required for the therapeutic effect of IFN-{$\beta$} in EAE. Suppression of Th17-biased EAE by IL-27 is IL-10-independent, in contrast to its mechanism of action in Th1-biased EAE. Taken together, these findings delineate a complex set of interdependent and independent immunoregulatory mechanisms of IFN-{$\beta$}, IL-27, and IL-10 in human experimental models and in murine Th1- and Th17-driven autoimmunity.},

  abstract = {Excessive inflammation occurs during infection and autoimmunity in mice lacking the -subunit of the interleukin 27 (IL-27) receptor. The molecular mechanisms underlying this increased inflammation are incompletely understood. Here we report that IL-27 upregulated IL-10 in effector T cells that produced interferon- and expressed the transcription factor T-bet but did not express the transcription factor Foxp3. These IFN-+T-bet+Foxp3- cells resembled effector T cells that have been identified as the main source of host-protective IL-10 during inflammation. IL-27-induced production of IL-10 was associated with less secretion of IL-17, and exogenous IL-27 reduced the severity of adoptively transferred experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by a mechanism dependent on IL-10. Our data show that IL-27-induced production of IL-10 by effector T cells contributes to the immunomodulatory function of IL-27.},

Less is known about the relative contributions of individual cell subpopulations, such as T(h)1 and T(h)17 cells, and their associated cytokines. The aim of the present study was to find immune correlates to vaccine-induced protection and further study their role in protection against H. pylori infection. Immunized and unimmunized mice were challenged with H. pylori, and immune responses were compared. Vaccine-induced protection was assessed by measuring H. pylori colonization in the stomach. Gastric gene expression of T(h)1- and/or T(h)17-associated cytokines was analyzed by quantitative PCR, and contributions of individual cytokines to protection were evaluated by antibody-mediated in vivo neutralization. By analyzing immunized and unimmunized mice, a significant inverse correlation between the levels of interleukin-12p40 (IL-12p40), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), gamma interferon (IFN-{$\gamma$}), and IL-17 gene expression and the number of H. pylori bacteria in the stomachs of individual animals after challenge could be demonstrated. In a kinetic study, upregulation of TNF, IFN-{$\gamma$}, and IL-17 coincided with vaccine-induced protection at 7 days after H. pylori challenge and was sustained for at least 21 days. In vivo neutralization of these cytokines during the effector phase of the immune response revealed a significant role for IL-17, but not for IFN-{$\gamma$} or TNF, in vaccine-induced protection. In conclusion, although both T(h)1- and T(h)17-associated gene expression in the stomach correlate with vaccine-induced protection against H. pylori infection, our study indicates that mainly T(h)17 effector mechanisms are of critical importance to protection.},

However, detergents are needed for the purification of full-length HpaA (HpaA(full)), which might confer toxicity, thus making HpaA(full) unsuitable for use in a human vaccine. We here describe a recombinantly produced truncated version of HpaA (HpaA(trunc)), which is easily purified without the use of detergents. Evaluation in the murine H. pylori infection model showed that sublingual immunization with HpaA(trunc) was equally immunogenic and protective as immunization with HpaA(full). Immunization with a combination of HpaA(trunc) and recombinant UreB protein induced strong immune responses to both antigens and importantly had a strong synergistic effect on protection, associated with synergistically increased expression of IL-17 in the stomach. Notably, sublingual immunization with HpaA(trunc) and UreB was superior to corresponding intragastric immunization with regard to the level of protection induced. In conclusion, HpaA(trunc) is a promising, readily produced, non-toxic recombinant antigen for inclusion in a mucosal vaccine against H. pylori infection, which may preferably be given sublingually together with UreB.},

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched through to December 2013. Conference proceedings between 2001 and 2013 were hand searched. A recursive search was performed with bibliographies of relevant studies. There were no language restrictions. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Randomised controlled trials examining the effect of at least seven days of eradication therapy on subsequent occurrence of gastric cancer in adults who tested positive for Helicobacter pylori but otherwise healthy and asymptomatic were eligible. The control arm had to receive placebo or no treatment. Subjects had to be followed for {$\geq$}2 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome, defined a priori, was the effect of eradication therapy on the subsequent occurrence of gastric cancer expressed as a relative risk of gastric cancer with 95\% confidence intervals. RESULTS The search strategy identified 1560 citations, of which six individual randomised controlled trials were eligible. Fifty one (1.6\%) gastric cancers occurred among 3294 individuals who received eradication therapy versus 76 (2.4\%) in 3203 control subjects (relative risk 0.66, 95\% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.95), with no heterogeneity between studies (I(2)=0\%, P=0.60). If the benefit of eradication therapy was assumed to persist lifelong the number needed to treat was as low as 15 for Chinese men and as high as 245 for US women. CONCLUSIONS These data provide limited, moderate quality evidence that searching for and eradicating H pylori reduces the incidence of gastric cancer in healthy asymptomatic infected Asian individuals, but these data cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other populations.},

A survey was conducted in order to assess the potential of Vietnamese and Cambodian live bird markets (LBMs) to sustain circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 (HPAIV H5N1). Thirty Vietnamese and 8 Cambodian LBMs were visited, and structured interviews were conducted with the market managers and 561 Vietnamese and 84 Cambodian traders. Multivariate and cluster analysis were used to construct a typology of traders based on their poultry management practices. As a result of those practices and large poultry surplus (unsold poultry reoffered for sale the following day), some poultry traders were shown to promote conditions favorable for perpetuating HPAIV H5N1 in LBMs. More than 80\% of these traders operated in LBMs located in the most densely populated areas, Ha Noi and Phnom Penh. The profiles of sellers operating at a given LBM could be reliably predicted using basic information about the location and type of market. Consequently, LBMs with the largest combination of risk factors for becoming virus reservoirs could be easily identified, potentially allowing control strategies to be appropriately targeted. These findings are of particular relevance to resource-scarce settings with extensively developed LBM systems, commonly found in South-East Asia.},

H. pylori strains that express the vacuolating cytotoxin or the outer membrane protein OipA are similarly associated with severe pathologic outcomes. We previously reported that an in vivo adapted H. pylori strain, 7.13, induces gastric adenocarcinoma in rodent models of gastritis. In the current study, we used carcinogenic strain 7.13 as a prototype to define the role of virulence constituents in H. pylori-mediated carcinogenesis. Mongolian gerbils were infected with wild-type strain 7.13 or cagA(-), vacA(-), or oipA(-) mutants for 12 to 52 weeks. All infected gerbils developed gastritis; however, inflammation was significantly attenuated in animals infected with the cagA(-) but not the vacA(-) or oipA(-) strains. Gastric dysplasia and cancer developed in {$>$}50\% of gerbils infected with either the wild-type or vacA(-) strain but in none of the animals infected with the cagA(-) strain. Inactivation of oipA decreased beta-catenin nuclear localization in vitro and reduced the incidence of cancer in gerbils. OipA expression was detected significantly more frequently among H. pylori strains isolated from human subjects with gastric cancer precursor lesions versus persons with gastritis alone. These results indicate that loss of CagA prevents the development of cancer in this model. Inactivation of oipA attenuates beta-catenin nuclear translocation and also decreases the incidence of carcinoma. In addition to defining factors that mediate H. pylori-induced cancer, these results provide insight into mechanisms that may regulate the development of other malignancies arising within the context of inflammatory states.},

How colonization with H. pylori affects the intestinal microbiota composition in humans is unknown. We investigated the association of H. pylori infection with intestinal microbiota composition in the population-based cohort Study-of-Health-in-Pomerania (SHIP)-TREND. Anti-H. pylori serology and H. pylori stool antigen tests were used to determine the H. pylori infection status. The fecal microbiota composition of 212\,H. pylori positive subjects and 212 matched negative control individuals was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. H. pylori infection was found to be significantly associated with fecal microbiota alterations and a general increase in fecal microbial diversity. In infected individuals, the H. pylori stool antigen load determined a larger portion of the microbial variation than age or sex. The highest H. pylori stool antigen loads were associated with a putatively harmful microbiota composition. This study demonstrates profound alterations in human fecal microbiota of H. pylori infected individuals. While the increased microbiota diversity associated with H. pylori infection as well as changes in abundance of specific genera could be considered to be beneficial, others may be associated with adverse health effects, reflecting the complex relationship between H. pylori and its human host.},

  abstract = {Mast-cell products can stimulate fibroblast proliferation, implying that these cells are key players in fibrosis. One mast-cell product, the serine protease tryptase, is known to activate protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) and cause proliferation of fibroblasts. We found that recombinant tryptase, human mast-cell (HMC-1) supernatant, which contains tryptase, and the PAR2-activating peptide SLIGKV exert fibroproliferative actions in human fibroblasts. Here we report insights into this action, which after activation of PAR2 leads to increased expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, and consequently to enhanced prostaglandin synthesis. Subsequent cell proliferation is mediated by the prostaglandin 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2), which acts via the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Fibroblast proliferation induced by tryptase and PAR2 agonist peptide can be blocked by antagonists of COX2 and PPARgamma, implying that the proliferative effect of tryptase is PAR2-initiated but depends on COX2, 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2), and PPARgamma. This previously uncharacterized pathway could be of relevance for human fibrotic diseases. For instance, increased numbers of activated mast cells are correlated with fibrosis in testes of infertile men. In these cases all components of the signaling pathway of tryptase were detected as well as expression of COX2. Therefore, our study describes as-yet-unknown interactions between mast cells and fibroblasts, which could be relevant for human fibrotic diseases.},

PURPOSE: To determine whether H. pylori eradication treatment can reduce the risk for gastric cancer. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and online clinical trial registers through 31 January 2009, without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials that compared eradication treatment with no treatment in H. pylori-positive patients and that assessed gastric cancer or progression of preneoplastic lesions during follow-up. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently reviewed articles and extracted data. DATA SYNTHESIS: Seven studies met inclusion criteria, 1 of which was excluded from pooled analysis because of clinical and methodological heterogeneity. All studies were performed in areas with high incidence of gastric cancer, mostly in Asia. Overall, 37 of 3388 (1.1\%) treated patients developed gastric cancer compared with 56 of 3307 (1.7\%) untreated (control) participants. In a pooled analysis of 6 studies with a total of 6695 participants followed from 4 to 10 years, the relative risk for gastric cancer was 0.65 (95\% CI, 0.43 to 0.98). LIMITATIONS: All studies but 1 were performed in Asia. Only 2 assessed gastric cancer incidence, and only 2 were double-blinded.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relation between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric cancer has been proven in epidemiological studies and animal experiments. Our aim was to investigate the prophylactic effect of H pylori eradication on the development of metachronous gastric carcinoma after endoscopic resection for early gastric cancer. METHODS: In this multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial, 544 patients with early gastric cancer, either newly diagnosed and planning to have endoscopic treatment or in post-resection follow-up after endoscopic treatment, were randomly assigned to receive an H pylori eradication regimen (n=272) or control (n=272). Randomisation was done by a computer-generated randomisation list and was stratified by whether the patient was newly diagnosed or post-resection. Patients in the eradication group received lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 750 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 200 mg twice daily for a week; those in the control group received standard care, but no treatment for H pylori. Patients were examined endoscopically at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after allocation. The primary endpoint was diagnosis of new carcinoma at another site in the stomach. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number UMIN000001169. FINDINGS: At 3-year follow-up, metachronous gastric carcinoma had developed in nine patients in the eradication group and 24 in the control group. In the full intention-to-treat population, including all patients irrespective of length of follow-up (272 patients in each group), the odds ratio for metachronous gastric carcinoma was 0.353 (95\% CI 0.161-0.775; p=0.009); in the modified intention-to-treat population, including patients with at least one post-randomisation assessment of tumour status and adjusting for loss to follow-up (255 patients in the eradication group, 250 in the control group), the hazard ratio for metachronous gastric carcinoma was 0.339 (95\% CI 0.157-0.729; p=0.003). In the eradication group, 19 (7\%) patients had diarrhoea and 32 (12\%) had soft stools. INTERPRETATION: Prophylactic eradication of H pylori after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer should be used to prevent the development of metachronous gastric carcinoma.

  abstract = {Neutrophils play a critical role in the host defense against bacterial and fungal infections, but their inappropriate activation also contributes to tissue damage during autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Neutrophils express a large number of cell surface receptors for the recognition of pathogen invasion and the inflammatory environment. Those include G-protein-coupled chemokine and chemoattractant receptors, Fc-receptors, adhesion receptors such as selectins/selectin ligands and integrins, various cytokine receptors, as well as innate immune receptors such as Toll-like receptors and C-type lectins. The various cell surface receptors trigger very diverse signal transduction pathways including activation of heterotrimeric and monomeric G-proteins, receptor-induced and store-operated Ca(2+) signals, protein and lipid kinases, adapter proteins and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Here we provide an overview of the receptors involved in neutrophil activation and the intracellular signal transduction processes they trigger. This knowledge is crucial for understanding how neutrophils participate in antimicrobial host defense and inflammatory tissue damage and may also point to possible future targets of the pharmacological therapy of neutrophil-mediated autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.},

This function appeared the prerogative of a restricted number of bacteria, the prototype of which is the segmented filamentous bacterium, a nonculturable Clostridia-related species, which could largely recapitulate the coordinated maturation of T cell responses induced by the whole mouse microbiota. This bacterium, already known as a potent inducer of mucosal IgA, likely plays a unique role in the postnatal maturation of gut immune functions. Changes in the infant flora may thus influence the development of host immune responses.},

Chemokines mediate migration of immune cells and other functions related to immunity. They are also involved in oncogenesis and in tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis through mechanisms similar to their roles in immune functions. Various chemokines also promote cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis of stressed cells. Consequently, chemokines and their receptors present potential therapeutic targets for anticancer drugs. The chemokine CXCL8, also known as interleukin-8 (IL8), is a proinflammatory molecule that has functions within the tumor microenvironment. Due to its potent angiogenic effects and the activity of the chemokine and its receptors in the promotion of invasion and metastasis, CXCL8 and its receptors are now considered as attractive targets for cancer therapy. This review relates the current understanding of the regulation, signaling, and functions of CXCL8 that contribute to tumor growth and metastasis, and of its role in drug response.},

We found that AhR activation promoted the differentiation of CD4(+)Foxp3(-) T cells, which produce IL-10 and control responder T cells through granzyme B. However, activation of AhR in the presence of transforming growth factor-beta1 induced Foxp3(+) iT(reg) cells, which suppress responder T cells through the ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase CD39. The induction of functional Foxp3(+) iT(reg) cells required coordinated action of the transcriptional regulators Smad1 and Aiolos.

In addition to TLRs, many other surface receptors have been proposed to participate in innate immunity and microbial recognition, and signaling through some of these receptors is likely to cooperate with TLR signaling in defining inflammatory responses. In this report we have examined how dectin-1, a lectin family receptor for beta-glucans, collaborates with TLRs in recognizing microbes. Dectin-1, which is expressed at low levels on macrophages and high levels on dendritic cells, contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-like signaling motif that is tyrosine phosphorylated upon activation. The receptor is recruited to phagosomes containing zymosan particles but not to phagosomes containing immunoglobulin G-opsonized particles. Dectin-1 expression enhances TLR-mediated activation of nuclear factor kappa B by beta-glucan-containing particles, and in macrophages and dendritic cells dectin-1 and TLRs are synergistic in mediating production of cytokines such as interleukin 12 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Additionally, dectin-1 triggers production of reactive oxygen species, an inflammatory response that is primed by TLR activation. The data demonstrate that collaborative recognition of distinct microbial components by different classes of innate immune receptors is crucial in orchestrating inflammatory responses.},

AIM: To evaluate gastric bacterial microbiota profiles in patients with GC and its precursor histological conditions. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study among 48 GC and 120 noncancer patients (20 normal gastric mucosa [control], 20 gastritis, 40 with atrophy and 40 intestinal metaplasia [IM]). We performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and compared taxonomic and functional prediction profiles based on the diagnosis group and H pylori infection status. RESULTS: The highest overall bacterial alpha diversity metrics were observed in the control group, followed by the IM and cancer groups. The gastritis and atrophy groups had the least diversity. Lactobacilli and Enterococci were the dominant genus in several cancer patients especially in the absence of H pylori. In addition, Carnobacterium, Glutamicibacter, Paeniglutamicibacter, Fusobacterium and Parvimonas were associated with GC regardless of H pylori infection. Firmicutes were decreased in the gastritis and atrophy groups and increased in the IM and cancer groups. The functional metabolic activity of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway and the utilization of sugar, were significantly increased in cancer group compared with the noncancer group. CONCLUSION: Microbial factors other than H pylori may play a role in Mongolian GC. We identified novel associations between GC and the genera Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Carnobacterium, Glutamicibacter, Paeniglutamicibacter, Fusobacterium, and Parvimonas.},

It was seen that H. pylori, chronic inflammatory infiltrate, neutrophilic infiltration, presence of lymphoid follicles and aggregates and surface epithelial damage are strongly associated with each other. The presence of one of these histological feature is a strong indicator for presence of other features. On the other hand intestinal metaplasia and atrophy of gastric glands was not associated with the above mentioned histological features. In the presence of dense chronic inflammation and infiltration by neutrophils one should carefully search for H. pylori organism. We also correlated histological features with endoscopy and found that cases of duodenal ulcer had more severe antral gastritis on histology as compared to those with hyperemia or antral erosions.},

To further characterize the H. pylori-mouse model, stomachs of unimmunized or intranasally immunized C57BL/6 mice were quantitatively cultured 3 days and 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 52 weeks after challenge with H. pylori. At 3 days and 1 week after challenge, colonization was the same in the immunized and unimmunized mice. By 2 weeks after challenge, the immunized mice had a {$>$}2-log decrease in bacterial load, and at all later time points, they either were culture negative or had at least a 2-log decrease in bacterial load. Gastritis in the immunized mice peaked at 1 to 2 weeks after challenge and was characterized by a mixed inflammatory infiltrate and epithelial proliferation centered at the transition between corpus and antrum. By 52 weeks postchallenge, the gastric histology in the immunized mice was not different from that in control unchallenged mice. The unimmunized group began to show a reduction in bacterial load as early as 16 weeks after challenge, and by 52 weeks seven of eight unimmunized mice had developed gastritis and reduced bacterial loads. These results indicate that prophylactic immunization does not prevent colonization by H. pylori but enables mice to clear the infection or significantly reduce the number of colonizing bacteria. The reduction in bacterial load is associated with gastric inflammation that subsides over time.},

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to May 2013; abstract books of major European, American, and Asian gastroenterological meetings. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials in previously untreated adults, in which sequential therapy was compared with a pre-existing or new therapy. RESULTS: 46 randomised controlled trials were reviewed and analysed. 5666 patients were randomised to sequential therapy and 7866 to other (established and new) treatments. The overall eradication rate of sequential therapy was 84.3\% (95\% confidence interval 82.1\% to 86.4\%). Sequential therapy was superior to seven day triple therapy (relative risk 1.21, 95\% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.25; I(2)=29.3\%; number needed to treat 6, 95\% confidence interval 5\% to 7\%), marginally superior to 10 day triple therapy (1.11, 1.04 to 1.19; I(2)= 67.2\%; NNT 10, 7 to 15), but not superior to 14 day triple therapy (1.00, 0.94 to 1.06; I(2)=54.3\%), bismuth based therapy (1.01, 0.95 to 1.06; I(2)=21.1\%), and non-bismuth based therapy (0.99, 0.94 to 1.05; I(2)=52.3\%). Data on eradication according to pre-treatment antimicrobial susceptibility testing were available in eight studies, and sequential therapy was able to eradicate 72.8\% (61.6\% to 82.8\%) of the strains resistant to clarithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: Eradication rates with pre-existing and new therapies for H pylori are suboptimal. Regional monitoring of resistance rates should help to guide treatment, and new agents for treatment need to be developed.},

Despite its important role, molecular and functional features conferred by Foxp3 to Tr precursor cells remain unknown. It has been suggested that Foxp3 expression is required for both survival of Tr precursors as well as their inability to produce interleukin (IL)-2 and independently proliferate after T-cell-receptor engagement, raising the possibility that such 'anergy' and Tr suppressive capacity are intimately linked. Here we show, by dissociating Foxp3-dependent features from those induced by the signals preceding and promoting its expression in mice, that the latter signals include several functional and transcriptional hallmarks of Tr cells. Although its function is required for Tr cell suppressor activity, Foxp3 to a large extent amplifies and fixes pre-established molecular features of Tr cells, including anergy and dependence on paracrine IL-2. Furthermore, Foxp3 solidifies Tr cell lineage stability through modification of cell surface and signalling molecules, resulting in adaptation to the signals required to induce and maintain Tr cells. This adaptation includes Foxp3-dependent repression of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3B, affecting genes responsible for Tr cell homeostasis.},

After infection, both innate and adaptive IL-17 responses have been reported, but the type of cells involved in innate IL-17 induction, as well as their contribution to in vivo responses, are poorly understood. Here we found that Citrobacter and Salmonella infection triggered early IL-17 production, which was crucial for host defense and was mediated by CD4(+) T helper cells. Enteric innate T helper type 17 (iT(H)17) responses occurred principally in the cecum, were dependent on the Nod-like receptors Nod1 and Nod2, required IL-6 induction and were associated with a decrease in mucosal CD103(+) dendritic cells. Moreover, imprinting by the intestinal microbiota was fully required for the generation of iT(H)17 responses. Together, these results identify the Nod-iT(H)17 axis as a central element in controlling enteric pathogens, which may implicate Nod-driven iT(H)17 responses in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases.},

This bacterium relies on the production of urease and hydrogenase to inhabit the acidic environment of the stomach. Nickel is an essential cofactor for urease and hydrogenase. H. pylori has to uptake sufficient nickel ions for the maturation of urease, and on the other way, to prevent the toxic effects of excessive nickel ions. Therefore, H. pylori has to strike a delicate balance between the import of nickel ions, its efficient intracellular storage, and delivery to nickel-dependent metalloenzymes when required. The assembly and maturation of the urease enzyme is a complex and timely ordered process, requiring various regulatory, uptake, chaperone and accessory proteins. In this review, we focus on several nickel trafficking proteins involved in urease maturation: NikR, NixA, HypAB, UreEFGH, HspA, Hpn and Hpnl. The work will deepen our understanding of how this pathogenic bacterium adapts to severe habitant environments in the host.},

  abstract = {With the rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, the eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) with standard treatments are decreasing to unacceptable levels (i.e., {$\leq$}80\%) in most countries. After these disappointing results, several authorities have proposed that infection with H. pylori should be approached and treated as any other bacterial infectious disease. This implicates that clinicians should prescribe empirical treatments yielding a per protocol eradication of at least 90\%. In recent years several treatments producing {$\geq$}90\% cure rates have been proposed including sequential therapy, concomitant quadruple therapy, hybrid (dual-concomitant) therapy, and bismuth-containing quadruple therapy. These treatments are likely to represent the recommended first-line treatments in the near future. In the present paper, we are considering a series of critical issues regarding currently available means and approaches for the management of H. pylori infection. Clinical needs and realistic endpoints are taken into account. Furthermore, emerging strategies for the eradication of H. pylori and the existing evidence of their clinical validation and widespread applicability are discussed.},

Biochemical studies, in vitro adherence assays, and in vivo animal models revealed that epithelial attachment of H. pylori can be mediated by the blood-group antigen-binding adhesin (BabA) targeting human Lewis(b) surface epitopes. Studies with transgenic mice expressing the Lewis(b) epitope have shown that such attachment can alter disease outcome. In the current study, the presence of the babA2 gene encoding the adhesin was investigated in clinical isolates from a German population by using PCR and reverse transcription-PCR. A positive genotype was correlated to allelic variations in the genes encoding VacA and CagA and also to the prevalence of duodenal ulcer, distal gastric adenocarcinoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and antral gastritis. The presence of babA2 was significantly associated with duodenal ulcer (P = 0.0002) and adenocarcinoma (P = 0.033). In contrast, type 1 strains (vacAs1- and cagA-positive) were associated with only duodenal ulcer (P = 0.004) but not adenocarcinoma (P = 0.235). Genotype presence of babA2, vacAs1, and cagA ("triple-positive" strains) showed a highly significant correlation to the prevalence of ulcer (P = 0.000002) and adenocarcinoma (P = 0.014) and discriminated significantly better between disease outcome than did the current type 1 classification. These results indicate that the babA2 gene is of high clinical relevance and would be a useful marker to identify patients who are at higher risk for specific H. pylori-related diseases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Although Helicobacter pylori is recognized by the human immune system, the bacteria are not eliminated and lead to a chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa. METHODS: We investigated the interaction of H. pylori with human lymphocytes. T and B lymphocytes were isolated from H. pylori-infected patients and stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 or interleukin-6. RESULTS: Proliferation of lymphocytes was abolished on co-incubation with different H. pylori strains (1-5 bacteria/cell) or with protein extracts of culture supernatants. Inhibition of proliferation was independent of known virulence factors. The factor is a protein or protein complex with an apparent molecular weight between 30 and 60 kilodaltons, clearly distinct from VacA. Although antigen-specific activation of T cells (as shown by nuclear factor of activated T cells [NFAT]-activation, interferon-gamma production, and CD25 or CD69 up-regulation) remained intact, cell-cycle analysis showed that S-phase entry of T cells was inhibited completely by H. pylori. Consequently, stimulated T cells arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Western blot analysis showed markedly reduced phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), suggesting inhibition of G1 cyclin-dependent kinase activity. In line with this, activities of cyclin D3 and cyclin E were down-regulated, and levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 were increased. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in p27 showed a decrease in H. pylori-induced inhibition of cell proliferation, suggesting a central role for p27 in mediating H. pylori-induced G1 arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Induction of cell-cycle arrest in lymphocytes may be of major significance for the chronic persistence of bacteria in the human stomach.},

Although crucial for T(H)17 cells in vivo, IL-23 has been thought to be incapable of driving initial differentiation. Rather, IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-{$\beta$}1 have been proposed to be the factors responsible for initiating specification. Here we show that T(H)17 differentiation can occur in the absence of TGF-{$\beta$} signalling. Neither IL-6 nor IL-23 alone efficiently generated T(H)17 cells; however, these cytokines in combination with IL-1{$\beta$} effectively induced IL-17 production in naive precursors, independently of TGF-{$\beta$}. Epigenetic modification of the Il17a, Il17f and Rorc promoters proceeded without TGF-{$\beta$}1, allowing the generation of cells that co-expressed ROR{$\gamma$}t (encoded by Rorc) and T-bet. T-bet(+)ROR{$\gamma$}t(+) T(H)17 cells are generated in vivo during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and adoptively transferred T(H)17 cells generated with IL-23 without TGF-{$\beta$}1 were pathogenic in this disease model. These data indicate an alternative mode for T(H)17 differentiation. Consistent with genetic data linking IL23R with autoimmunity, our findings re-emphasize the importance of IL-23 and therefore may have therapeutic implications.},

  abstract = {Microbial evolution and subsequent species diversification enable bacterial organisms to perform common biological processes by a variety of means. The epsilonproteobacteria are a diverse class of prokaryotes that thrive in diverse habitats. Many of these environmental niches are labeled as extreme, whereas other niches include various sites within human, animal, and insect hosts. Some epsilonproteobacteria, such as Campylobacter jejuni and Helicobacter pylori, are common pathogens of humans that inhabit specific regions of the gastrointestinal tract. As such, the biological processes of pathogenic Campylobacter and Helicobacter spp. are often modeled after those of common enteric pathogens such as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli. While many exquisite biological mechanisms involving biochemical processes, genetic regulatory pathways, and pathogenesis of disease have been elucidated from studies of Salmonella spp. and E. coli, these paradigms often do not apply to the same processes in the epsilonproteobacteria. Instead, these bacteria often display extensive variation in common biological mechanisms relative to those of other prototypical bacteria. In this review, five biological processes of commonly studied model bacterial species are compared to those of the epsilonproteobacteria C. jejuni and H. pylori. Distinct differences in the processes of flagellar biosynthesis, DNA uptake and recombination, iron homeostasis, interaction with epithelial cells, and protein glycosylation are highlighted. Collectively, these studies support a broader view of the vast repertoire of biological mechanisms employed by bacteria and suggest that future studies of the epsilonproteobacteria will continue to provide novel and interesting information regarding prokaryotic cellular biology.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a cytokine that has regulatory effects on T and natural killer (NK) cells and is composed of two disulfide-bonded subunits, p40 and p35. It was recently reported that supernatants from cultures of mouse IL-12 (moIL-12) p40-transfected COS cells could inhibit IL-12-dependent responses in vitro (Mattner, F., et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 1993. 23: 2202). We have further characterized the nature of the inhibitory substance. Purified mouse p40 produced in a baculovirus expression system was found to consist of two species: the p40 monomer and a disulfide-linked p40 dimer [(p40)2]. The (p40)2 was 25- to 50-fold more active than the p40 monomer in causing specific, dose-dependent inhibition of IL-12-induced mouse concanavalin A (Con A) blast proliferation and could also inhibit IL-12-induced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion by mouse splenocytes and IL-12-dependent activation of mouse NK cells. Competitive binding studies on mouse Con A blasts showed that (p40)2 was equally effective as moIL-12 in competing with 125I-labeled moIL-12 ([125I]moIL-12) for binding to mouse Con A blasts. However, in contrast to moIL-12, mouse (p40)2 displayed little ability to compete with 125I-labeled human IL-12 (huIL-12) for binding to high-affinity IL-12 receptors (IL-12R) on human phytohemagglutinin (PHA) blasts and caused little or no inhibition of huIL-12-induced human PHA blast proliferation. Nonetheless, mouse (p40)2 was equally effective as moIL-12 in competing with [125I] huIL-12 for binding to COS cells transfected with the human IL-12R beta subunit and expressing low-affinity IL-12 binding sites. These results suggest that (i) the majority of the structural determinants required for binding of IL-12 to its receptor are contained within the p40 subunit, but p35 is required for signaling, (ii) the p40 subunit of IL-12 interacts with the beta subunit of IL-12R, and (iii) (p40)2 may be a suitable IL-12 antagonist for studying the role of IL-12 in various immune responses in vivo as well as in vitro. Further studies are required to determine whether or not (p40)2 is produced by normal lymphoid cells and is a physiologic regulator of IL-12 activity.},

Addition of O-glycans onto proteins is an extremely complex process that regulates both sites of attachment and the types of oligosaccharides added. Twenty distinct polypeptide GalNAc-transferases (GalNAc-Ts) initiate O-glycosylation and fine-tuning their expression provides a mechanism for regulating this action. Recently, a new mode of regulation has emerged where activation of Src kinase selectively redistributes Golgi-localized GalNAc-Ts to the ER. This relocalization results in a strong increase in the density of O-glycan decoration. In this review, we discuss how different mechanisms can regulate the number and the types of O-glycans decorating proteins. In addition, we speculate how Src-dependent relocation of GalNAc-Ts could play an important role in cancerous cellular transformation.},

METHODS: Antral mucosal biopsies were obtained from 20 children with H pylori(+) gastritis and 20 age- and sex-matched normal controls. Histopathology was assessed by the updated Sydney classification. Gene expression of FOXP3, IL-10, and TGF-{$\beta$}1 was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemical staining for FOXP3+ Treg and TH17 cells was performed. RESULTS: The gene expression levels of FOXP3, TGF-{$\beta$}1, and IL-10 messenger RNA (mRNA) and the number of FOXP3+ Treg were significantly higher in the H pylori(+) gastritis group than in the control group (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.01). FOXP3 mRNA levels were correlated positively with TGF-{$\beta$}1 and IL-10 mRNA levels in the H pylori(+) gastritis group (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.05). Furthermore, FOXP3 mRNA levels were correlated positively with the bacterial density, infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells, and mononuclear cells in the H pylori(+) gastritis group (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.05). The number of TH17 cells was significantly higher in the H pylori(+) gastritis group than in the control group (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.05). In addition, the number of TH17 cells was correlated negatively with the bacterial density and positively with the inflammatory scores of polymorphonuclear cells and mononuclear cells in the H pylori(+) gastritis group (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.05). A negative correlation between the TH17 cells/FOXP3+ Treg ratio and the bacterial density was demonstrated in the H pylori(+) gastritis group (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that a TH17/Treg balance toward a Treg-biased response favors the persistence of bacteria, causing chronic active gastritis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and a meta-analysis of accuracy of monoclonal stool antigen test (SAT) for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection. METHODS: Selection of studies: assessing the accuracy of monoclonal SAT for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. Search strategy: electronic and manual bibliographical searches. Data extraction: independently done by two reviewers. Data synthesis: meta-analyses combining the sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios (LRs) of the individual studies. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies, including 2,499 patients, evaluated the monoclonal SAT before eradication therapy. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, LR+, and LR- were: 0.94 (95\% CI 0.93-0.95), 0.97 (0.96-0.98), 24 (15-41), and 0.07 (0.04-0.12). The accuracy of both monoclonal and polyclonal SAT was evaluated together in 13 pretreatment studies, and higher pooled sensitivity was demonstrated with the monoclonal technique (0.95 vs 0.83). Twelve studies, including 957 patients, assessed the monoclonal SAT to confirm eradication after therapy. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, LR+, and LR- were 0.93 (0.89-0.96), 0.96 (0.94-0.97), 17 (12-23), and 0.1 (0.07-0.15). Both tests were evaluated together in eight post-treatment studies and, again, the monoclonal technique showed higher sensitivity (0.91 vs 0.76). Heterogeneity among studies disappeared when a single outlier study was excluded. Subanalysis depending on the reference method, the study population, or the study quality showed similar results. CONCLUSION: Monoclonal SAT is an accurate noninvasive method both for the initial diagnosis of H. pylori infection and for the confirmation of its eradication after treatment. The monoclonal technique has higher sensitivity than the polyclonal one, especially in the post-treatment setting.},

Some studies have found no differences between urea breath test performed under non-fasting conditions. The simplicity, good tolerance and economy of the citric acid test meal probably make its systematic use advisable. The urea breath test protocol may be performed with relatively low doses ({$<$}100 mg) of urea: 75 mg or even 50 mg seem to be sufficient. With the most widely used protocol (with citric acid and 75 mg of urea), excellent accuracy is obtained when breath samples are collected as early as 10-15 min after urea ingestion. A unique and generally proposed cut-off level is not possible because it has to be adapted to different factors, such as the test meal, the dose and type of urea, or the pre-/post-treatment setting. Fortunately, because positive and negative urea breath test results tend to cluster outside of the range between 2 and 5 per thousand, a change in cut-off value within this range would be expected to have little effect on clinical accuracy of the test.},

Studies have shown the presence of H. pylori in drinking water and the role of poor living conditions and sanitation in H. pylori infection, supporting an oral-fecal route of spread. Screening for H. pylori as a gastric cancer pre-screening strategy has been described in Japan, and the importance of H. pylori eradication as a gastric cancer-prevention strategy has now been further emphasized in Japanese guidelines.

But its mechanism of pathogenesis is not firmly established. This study aims to examine its role in H pylori-mediated infection. METHODS: Various H pylori isogenic mutants were constructed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach. H pylori native GGT protein (HP-nGGT) was purified with ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. Generation of H2O2 was measured with fluorimetric analysis, whereas nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation was determined by luciferase assay and Western blot. Cytokine production was examined by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay and real-time PCR. DNA damage was assessed with comet assay and flow cytometry. The GGT activity of 98 H pylori isolates was analyzed by an enzymatic assay. RESULTS: Purified HP-nGGT generated H2O2 in primary gastric epithelial cells and AGS gastric cancer cells, resulting in the activation of NF-kappaB and up-regulation of interleukin-8 (IL-8) production. In addition, HP-nGGT caused an increase in the level of 8-OH-dG, indicative of oxidative DNA damage. In contrast, Deltaggt showed significantly reduced levels of H2O2 generation, IL-8 production, and DNA damage in cells compared with the wild type (P{$<$}.05). The clinical importance of GGT was indicated by significantly higher (P{$<$}.001) activity in H pylori isolates obtained from patients with peptic ulcer disease (n=54) than isolates from patients with nonulcer dyspepsia (n=44). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence that GGT is a pathogenic factor associated with H pylori-induced peptic ulcer disease.},

The secreted VacA toxin is an important H. pylori virulence factor that causes multiple alterations in gastric epithelial cells and T cells. Several families of vacA alleles have been described, and H. pylori strains containing certain vacA types (s1, i1, and m1) are associated with an increased risk of gastric disease, compared to strains containing other vacA types (s2, i2, and m2). Thus far, there has been relatively little study of the role of the VacA intermediate region (i-region) in toxin activity. In this study, we compared the ability of i1 and i2 forms of VacA to cause functional alterations in Jurkat cells. To do this, we manipulated the chromosomal vacA gene in two H. pylori strains to introduce alterations in the region encoding the VacA i-region. We did not detect any differences in the capacity of i1 and i2 forms of VacA to cause vacuolation of RK13 cells. In comparison to i1 forms of VacA, i2 forms of VacA had a diminished capacity to inhibit the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and suppress interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. Correspondingly, i2 forms of VacA bound to Jurkat cells less avidly than did i1 forms of VacA. These results indicate that the VacA i-region is an important determinant of VacA effects on human T cell function.},

It has unique cellular fatty acids, predominantly tetradecanoic acid and cis-11, 12 methylene octadecanoic acid. It also has a unique ultrastructure which is different from that of other campylobacters. C pyloridis possesses a powerful urease enzyme and produces large amounts of extracellular catalase. Both these features may be important virulence factors, allowing it to occupy a protected niche in the stomach below the mucus layer but above the gastric mucosa. Specific lesions are found in the gastric mucosa, and ultrastructural studies show the presence of adherence pedestals identical with those found with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli of the intestine. Histological examination of gastric biopsy tissue has shown that C pyloridis is strongly associated with active chronic gastritis, when polymorphonuclear leucocytes are present, and is not found on normal mucosa except when a biopsy specimen from elsewhere in the stomach shows active chronic gastritis. When patients with symptoms caused by gastritis are identified dual antibacterial treatment, combining the action of bismuth in the stomach with a systemic antibiotic, can eradicate C pyloridis, with remission of symptoms and restoration of normal epithelial morphology. Most peptic ulcers relapse after modern acid reducing treatment, and antibacterial treatment may be beneficial in preventing relapse.},

  abstract = {The type IV secretion system (T4SS) of Helicobacter pylori triggers massive inflammatory responses during gastric infection by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here we provide evidence for a novel pathway by which the T4SS structural component, CagL, induces secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8) independently of CagA translocation and peptidoglycan-sensing nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) signalling. Recombinant CagL was sufficient to trigger IL-8 secretion, requiring activation of {$\alpha$}(5) {$\beta$}(1) integrin and the arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) motif in CagL. Mutation of the encoded RGD motif to arginine-glycine-alanine (RGA) in the cagL gene of H.\,pylori abrogated its ability to induce IL-8. Comparison of IL-8 induction between H.\,pylori {$\Delta$}virD4 strains bearing wild-type or mutant cagL indicates that CagL-dependent IL-8 induction can occur independently of CagA translocation. In line with this notion, exogenous CagL complemented H.\,pylori {$\Delta$}cagL mutant in activating NF-{$\kappa$}B and inducing IL-8 without restoring CagA translocation. The CagA translocation-independent, CagL-dependent IL-8induction involved host signalling via integrin {$\alpha$}(5) {$\beta$}(1) , Src kinase, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and NF-{$\kappa$}B but was independent of NOD1. Our findings reveal a novel pathway whereby CagL, via interaction with host integrins, can trigger pro-inflammatory responses independently of CagA translocation or NOD1 signalling.},

Forty-seven (5.7\%) mice from six (12.8\%) colonies were contaminated with both H. hepaticus and H. rodentium. H. rodentium was detected in rats from three (30.0\%) colonies. In gerbils, H. hepaticus was detected in three (75.0\%) colonies, but other species of Helicobacter were not detected. In house musk shrews, "H. suncus" was detected in animals from two (66.7\%) colonies.

The choice of variables used to describe habitats is crucial and need to be relevant to the ecology and behaviour of the species, in order to reflect biologically meaningful distribution patterns. In many species, acoustic communication is critical to individuals' interactions, and it is expected that ambient acoustic conditions impact their local distribution. Yet, classic animal ecology rarely integrates an acoustic dimension in habitat descriptions. Here we show that ambient sound pressure level (SPL) is a strong predictor of calling site selection in acoustically active frog species. In comparison to six other habitat-related variables (i.e. air and water temperature, depth, width and slope of the stream, substrate), SPL had the most important explanatory power in microhabitat selection for the 34 sampled species. Ambient noise was particularly useful in differentiating two stream-associated guilds: torrents and calmer streams dwelling species. Guild definitions were strongly supported by SPL, whereas slope, which is commonly used in stream-associated habitat, had a weak explanatory power. Moreover, slope measures are non-standardized across studies and are difficult to assess at small scale. We argue that including an acoustic descriptor will improve habitat-species analyses for many acoustically active taxa. SPL integrates habitat topology and temporal information (such as weather and hour of the day, for example) and is a simple and precise measure. We suggest that habitat description in animal ecology should include an acoustic measure such as noise level because it may explain previously misunderstood distribution patterns.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A reliable challenge model is needed to evaluate Helicobacter pylori vaccine candidates. METHODS: A cag pathogenicity island negative, OipA positive, multiple antibiotic susceptible strain of H pylori obtained from an individual with mild gastritis (Baylor strain 100) was used to challenge volunteers. Volunteers received 40 mg of famotidine at bedtime and 10(4)-10(10) cfu of H pylori in beef broth the next morning. Infection was confirmed by (13)C urea breath test ((13)C-UBT), culture, and histology. Eradication therapy was given four or 12 weeks post challenge and eradication was confirmed by at least two separate UBTs, as well as culture and histology. RESULTS: Twenty subjects (nine women and 11 men; aged 23-33 years) received a H pylori challenge. Eighteen (90\%) became infected. Mild to moderate dyspeptic symptoms occurred, peaked between days 9 and 12, and resolved. Vomitus from one subject contained {$>$}10(3) viable/ml H pylori. By two weeks post challenge gastric histology showed typical chronic H pylori gastritis with intense acute and chronic inflammation. The density of H pylori (as assessed by cfu/biopsy) was similarly independent of the challenge dose. A minimal infectious dose was not found. Gastric mucosal interleukin 8 levels increased more than 20-fold by two weeks after the challenge. CONCLUSION: Challenge reliably resulted in H pylori infection. Infection was associated with typical H pylori gastritis with intense polymorphonuclear cell infiltration and interleukin 8 induction in gastric mucosa, despite absence of the cag pathogenicity island. Experimental H pylori infection is one of the viable approaches to evaluate vaccine candidates.},

  abstract = {Disease due to the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori varies in severity from asymptomatic to peptic ulcer disease and cancer. Accumulating evidence suggests that one source of this variation is an abnormal host response. The goal of this study was to use a mouse model of H. pylori gastritis to investigate the roles of regulatory T cells (Treg) as well as proinflammatory T cells (Th1 and Th17) in gastritis, gastric T cell engraftment, and gastric cytokine production. Our results support published data indicating that severe gastritis in T cell recipient mice is due to failure of Treg engraftment, that Treg ameliorate gastritis, and that the proinflammatory response is attributable to interactions between several cell subsets and cytokines. We confirmed that gamma interferon (IFN-{$\gamma$}) is essential for induction of gastritis but showed that IFN-{$\gamma$}-producing CD4 T cells are not necessary. Interleukin 17A (IL-17A) also contributed to gastritis, but to a lesser extent than IFN-{$\gamma$}. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-{$\alpha$}) and IL-17F were also elevated in association with disease. These results indicate that while H. pylori-specific CD4(+) T cells and IFN-{$\gamma$} are both essential for induction of gastritis due to H. pylori, IFN-{$\gamma$} production by T cells is not essential. It is likely that other proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17F and TNF-{$\alpha$}, shown to be elevated in this model, also contribute to the induction of disease. We suggest that gastritis due to H. pylori is associated with loss of immunoregulation and alteration of several cytokines and cell subsets and cannot be attributed to a single immune pathway.},

In contrast to the naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) that emerge directly from the thymus, Tr1 cells are induced by antigen stimulation via an IL-10-dependent process in vitro and in vivo. Specialized IL-10-producing dendritic cells, such as those in an immature state or those modulated by tolerogenic stimuli, play a key role in this process. We propose to use the term Tr1 cells for all IL-10-producing T-cell populations that are induced by IL-10 and have regulatory activity. The full biological characterization of Tr1 cells has been hampered by the difficulty in generating these cells in vitro and by the lack of specific marker molecules. However, it is clear that Tr1 cells play a key role in regulating adaptive immune responses both in mice and in humans. Further work to delineate the specific molecular signature of Tr1 cells, to determine their relationship with CD4+CD25+ Tregs, and to elucidate their respective role in maintaining peripheral tolerance is crucial to advance our knowledge on this Treg subset. Furthermore, results from clinical protocols using Tr1 cells to modulate immune responses in vivo in autoimmunity, transplantation, and chronic inflammatory diseases will undoubtedly prove the biological relevance of these cells in immunotolerance.},

DC-SIGN was constitutively associated with a signalosome complex consisting of the scaffold proteins LSP1, KSR1 and CNK and the kinase Raf-1. Mannose-expressing Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) induced the recruitment of effector proteins to the DC-SIGN signalosome to activate Raf-1, whereas fucose-expressing pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori actively dissociated the KSR1-CNK-Raf-1 complex from the DC-SIGN signalosome. This dynamic regulation of the signalosome by mannose- and fucose-expressing pathogens led to the enhancement or suppression of proinflammatory responses, respectively. Our study reveals another level of plasticity in tailoring adaptive immunity to pathogens.},

The current studies were undertaken to identify the genetic mechanisms regulating H. pylori-dependent MUC1 expression by gastric epithelial cells. Treatment of AGS cells with H. pylori increased MUC1 mRNA and protein levels, and augmented MUC1 gene promoter activity, compared with untreated cells. H. pylori increased binding of STAT3 and MUC1 itself to the MUC1 gene promoter within a region containing a STAT3 binding site, and decreased CpG methylation of the MUC1 promoter proximal to the STAT3 binding site, compared with untreated cells.

However, greater than 80\% of individuals infected with H. pylori are asymptomatic beyond histologic inflammation, and it is unknown what factors influence the incidence and character of bacterial-associated gastritis and related disorders. Because previous studies demonstrated that the Muc1 epithelial glycoprotein inhibited inflammation during acute lung infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we asked whether Muc1 might also counter-regulate gastric inflammation in response to H. pylori infection. Muc1(-/-) mice displayed increased bacterial colonization of the stomach and greater TNF-alpha and keratinocyte chemoattractant transcript levels compared with Muc1(+/+) mice after experimental H. pylori infection. Knockdown of Muc1 expression in AGS human gastric epithelial cells by RNA interference was associated with increased phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, augmented activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, and enhanced production of interleulin-8 compared with Muc1-expressing cells. Conversely, Muc1 overexpression was correlated with decreased NF-kappaB activation, reduced interleulin-8 production, and diminished IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta)/IKKgamma coimmunoprecipitation compared with cells expressing Muc1 endogenously. Cotransfection of AGS cells with Muc1 plus IKKbeta, but not a catalytically inactive IKKbeta mutant, reversed the Muc1 inhibitory effect. Finally, Muc1 formed a coimmunoprecipitation complex with IKKgamma but not with IKKbeta. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Muc1 binds to IKKgamma, thereby inhibiting formation of the catalytically active IKK complex and blocking the ability of H. pylori to stimulate IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, NF-kappaB activation, and downstream inflammatory responses.},

We incubated H. pylori with cultured human dendritic cells and measured the cytokine induction profile, comparing the response to that induced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. We found that H. pylori induced little interleukin 6 (IL-6) and essentially no IL-10 in contrast to S. enterica. However, H. pylori induced levels of IL-12 that were 30\% of those induced by S. enterica, indicating a Th1 response. An isogenic cagE mutant of H. pylori lost about 50\% of its IL-12-inducing ability, suggesting a role for the cag type IV secretion system in the stimulation of dendritic cells.},

The frequency of transformation varied between 5 x 10(-4) and 4 x 10(-6), depending on the H. pylori isolate used. Transposon shuttle mutagenesis based on this natural competence was established using the flagellin gene flaA as the target. The cloned flaA gene was interrupted by insertion of TnMax1, a mini-Tn1721 transposon carrying a modified chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase gene, the catGC cassette. Natural transformation of competent H. pylori strains with plasmid constructs harbouring a catGC-inactivated flaA gene resulted in chloramphenicol-resistant transformants at an average frequency of 4 x 10(-5). Southern hybridization experiments confirmed the replacement of the chromosomal H. pylori flaA gene by the cat-inactivated cloned gene copy via homologous recombination resulting in allelic exchange. Phenotypic characterization of the mutants demonstrated the absence of flagella under the electron microscope and the loss of bacterial motility. Immunoblots of cell lysates of the H. pylori mutants with an antiserum raised against the C-terminal portion of recombinant H. pylori major flagellin (FlaA) confirmed the absence of the 54 kDa FlaA protein. This efficient transposon shuttle mutagenesis procedure for H. pylori based on natural competence opens up new possibilities for the genetic assessment of putative H. pylori virulence determinants.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUNDS: Helicobacter pylori colonize the gastric mucosa of half of the world's population. Although it is classified as a definitive type I carcinogen by World Health Organization, there is no effective vaccine against this bacterium. H. pylori evade the host immune response by avoiding toll-like detection, such as detection via toll-like receptor-5 (TLR-5). Thus, a chimeric construct consisting of selected epitopes from virulence factors that is incorporated into a TLR-5 ligand (Pseudomonas flagellin) could result in more potent innate and adaptive immune responses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the histocompatibility antigens of BALB/c mice, in silico techniques were used to select several fragments from H. pylori virulence factors with a high density of B- and T-cell epitopes. RESULTS: These segments consist of cytotoxin-associated geneA (residue 162-283), neutrophil activating protein (residue 30-135) and outer inflammatory protein A (residue 155-268). The secondary and tertiary structure of the chimeric constructs and other bioinformatics analyses such as stability, solubility, and antigenicity were performed. The chimeric construct containing antigenic segments of H. pylori proteins was fused with the D3 domain of Pseudomonas flagellin. This recombinant chimeric gene was optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. The in silico results showed that the conserved C- and N-terminal domains of flagellin and the antigenicity of selected fragments were retained. DISCUSSION: In silico analysis showed that Pseudomonas flagellin is a suitable platform for incorporation of an antigenic construct from H. pylori. This strategy may be an effective tool for the control of H. pylori and other persistent infections.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is a helical-shaped, gram negative bacterium that colonizes the human gastric niche of half of the human population. H. pylori is the primary cause of gastric cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. One virulence factor that has been associated with increased risk of gastric disease is the Cag-pathogenicity island, a 40-kb region within the chromosome of H. pylori that encodes a type IV secretion system and the cognate effector molecule, CagA. The Cag-T4SS is responsible for translocating CagA and peptidoglycan into host epithelial cells. The activity of the Cag-T4SS results in numerous changes in host cell biology including upregulation of cytokine expression, activation of proinflammatory pathways, cytoskeletal remodeling, and induction of oncogenic cell-signaling networks. The Cag-T4SS is a macromolecular machine comprised of sub-assembly components spanning the inner and outer membrane and extending outward from the cell into the extracellular space. The extracellular portion of the Cag-T4SS is referred to as the "pilus". Numerous studies have demonstrated that the Cag-T4SS pili are formed at the host-pathogen interface(. However, the environmental features that regulate the biogenesis of this important organelle remain largely obscure. Recently, we reported that conditions of low iron availability increased the Cag-T4SS activity and pilus biogenesis. Here we present an optimized protocol to grow H. pylori in varying conditions of iron availability prior to co-culture with human gastric epithelial cells. Further, we present the comprehensive protocol for visualization of the hyper-piliated phenotype exhibited in iron restricted conditions by high resolution scanning electron microscopy analyses.},

We used the 6E10 antibody and immunopurified A{$\beta$} peptides and glycopeptides from CSF samples and then liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for structural analysis using collision-induced dissociation and electron capture dissociation. In addition to 33 unglycosylated APP/A{$\beta$} peptides, we identified 37 APP/A{$\beta$} glycopeptides with sialylated core 1 like O-glycans attached to Thr(-39, -21, -20, and -13), in a series of APP/A{$\beta$}X-15 glycopeptides, where X was -63, -57, -52, and -45, in relation to Asp1 of the A{$\beta$} sequence.

The Tyr10 linked O-glycans were (Neu5Ac)(1-2)Hex(Neu5Ac)HexNAc-O- structures with the disialylated terminals occasionally O-acetylated or lactonized, indicating a terminal Neu5Ac{$\alpha$}2,8Neu5Ac linkage. We could not detect any glycosylation of the A{$\beta$}1-38/40/42 isoforms. We observed an increase of up to 2.5 times of Tyr10 glycosylated A{$\beta$} peptides in CSF in six AD patients compared to seven non-AD patients.

Our studies demonstrate that interleukin-27 (IL-27) also promoted expression of T-bet and CXCR3 in Treg cells. During infection with Toxoplasma gondii, a similar population emerged that limited T~cell responses and was dependent on IFN-{$\gamma$} in the periphery but on IL-27 at mucosal sites. Transfer of Treg cells ameliorated the infection-induced pathology observed in Il27(-/-) mice, and this was dependent on their ability to produce IL-10. Microarray analysis revealed that Treg cells exposed to either IFN-{$\gamma$} or IL-27 have distinct transcriptional profiles. Thus, IFN-{$\gamma$} and IL-27 have different roles in Treg cell biology and IL-27 is a key cytokine that promotes the development of Treg cells specialized to control Th1 cell-mediated immunity at local sites of inflammation.},

METHODS: One hundred and forty-one strains of H. pylori were isolated from gastric biopsies of 43 patients with chronic gastritis, 47 with duodenal ulcer (DU), 30 with gastric ulcer (GU) and 21 with non-cardia gastric carcinoma. The iceA, babA2, cagA and vacA genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The iceA1, iceA2 and babA2 genotypes were detected in 74.5\% (105/141), 15.6\% (22/141) and 63.8\% (90/141), respectively, of the H. pylori strains studied. Two H. pylori isolates (1.4\%) were positive for both iceA alleles and 16 (11.3\%) were negative for both. The prevalence of babA2 and its combination with cagA (cagA(+)/babA2(+)) in DU patients was significantly higher than that in GU patients (74.5\%vs 50.0\% for babA2, P = 0.028; 70.2\%vs 46.7\% for cagA(+)/babA2(+), P = 0.039). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of babA2 among the other disease groups, and no significant association of the iceA genotypes with the different clinical diseases (P {$>$} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The most predominant genotype of the H. pylori strains isolated from patients in Shanghai are iceA1(+)/babA2(+), and the babA2 genotype may play a different role in the pathogenesis of DU and GU. An association between iceA status and clinical outcome of H. pylori infection could not be confirmed in the present study.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori infects up to 50\% of the human population worldwide. The infection occurs predominantly in childhood and persists for decades or a lifetime. H. pylori is believed to be transmitted from person to person. However, tremendous genetic diversity has been reported for these bacteria. In order to gain insight into the epidemiological basis of this phenomenon, we performed molecular typing of H. pylori isolates from different families. Fifty-nine H. pylori isolates from 27 members of nine families were characterized by using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of five PCR-amplified genes, by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA, and by vacA and cagA genotyping. The 16S rRNA gene exhibited little allelic variation, as expected for a unique bacterial species. In contrast, the vacA, flaA, ureAB, and lspA-glmM genes were highly polymorphic, with a mean genetic diversity of 0.83, which exceeds the levels recorded for all other bacterial species. In conjunction with PFGE, 59 H. pylori isolates could be differentiated into 21 clonal types. Each individual harbored only one clone, occasionally with a clonal variant. Identical strains were always found either between siblings or between a mother and her children. Statistical analysis revealed clonality of population structure in all isolates. The results of this study suggest the possible coexistence of a large array of clonal lineages that are evolving in each individual in isolation from one another. Transmission appears to occur primarily from mother to child and perhaps between siblings.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a cyclic on-column procedure for the sequential degradation of complex O-glycans on proteins by periodate oxidation of sugars and cleavage of oxidation products by elimination. Glycoproteins are immobilized to alkali-stable, reversed-phase Poros 20 beads, desialylated by treatment with dilute trifluoroacetic acid, and de-O-glycosylated by two degradation cycles before the eluted apoproteins are digested with trypsin for analysis by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Even complex glycan moieties are removed under mild conditions with only minimal effects on structural integrity of the peptide core by fragmentation, dehydration, or racemization of lysine and arginine residues. The protocol is also applicable on gel-immobilized glycoproteins after 1D or 2D gel electrophoresis. Conversion of O-glycoproteins into their corresponding apoproteins results in facilitated accessibility of tryptic cleavage sites, increases the numbers of peptide fragments, and accordingly enhances protein coverage and identification rates within the subproteome of mucin-type O-glycoproteins. The protocol is suitable for automatization, but due to partial elution from the Poros 20 columns it is not recommended for applications on the glycopeptide level.},

On the peptide level, a site localization and characterization of O-linked glycans in situ using tandem MS with electron-transfer dissociation or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) MS with postsource decay have been reported.

It allows a ladder sequencing from both termini with assignment of O-glycosylation sites based on intense c-, y-, and z-type ions. The feasibility of ISD-MALDI-MS in the localization of O-glycosylation sites was demonstrated with synthetic O-glycopeptides, the tandem repeat domain of recombinant MUC1, and the natural bovine glycoproteins asialofetuin and desialylated {$\kappa$}-casein. Ladder sequencing of the 17-18.5 kD MUC1 hexarepeat domains revealed (1) cell-specific glycosylation site patterns on comparison of probes expressed in human HEK-293 or Drosophila S2 cells, and (2) a site-specific microheterogeneity at the Thr/Ser sites with variations of the glycan compositions from zero to four monosaccharides. Novel O-glycosylation sites in the C-terminal domains of fetuin (T334) and {$\kappa$}-caseinoglycopeptide (S154 and T156) were assigned, the former representing a sequence conflict with the published T154.},

This paper demonstrates that Runx3 is expressed in colonic mononuclear phagocytes (MNP), including resident macrophages (RM) and dendritic cell subsets (cDC2). Runx3 deletion in MNP causes early onset colitis due to their impaired maturation. Mechanistically, the resulting MNP subset imbalance leads to up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes as occurs in IL10R-deficient RM. In addition, RM and cDC2 display a marked decrease in expression of anti-inflammatory/TGF {$\beta$}-regulated genes and {$\beta$}-catenin signaling associated genes, respectively. MNP transcriptome and ChIP-seq data analysis suggest that a significant fraction of genes affected by Runx3 loss are direct Runx3 targets. Collectively, Runx3 imposes intestinal immune tolerance by regulating maturation of colonic anti-inflammatory MNP, befitting the identification of RUNX3 as a genome-wide associated risk gene for various immune-related diseases in humans, including gastrointestinal tract diseases such as Crohn's disease and celiac.},

CBA mice are nonresponsive to gastric Helicobacter infection, providing a useful model for examining host regulation of Helicobacter-induced gastritis. We examined whether gastric Helicobacter nonresponsiveness impacts upon vaccine efficacy and whether immune-mediated protection could occur in the absence of inflammation. METHODS: Mice were vaccinated prior to challenge with Helicobacter felis or H. pylori. Gastritis and H. felis colonization was evaluated histologically. H. pylori colonization was quantified by colony-forming assay. RESULTS: Immunizations protected CBA mice against challenge with either H. felis or H. pylori. Protection against H. felis was marked by a loss of nonresponsiveness and development of an atrophic gastritis with mucus metaplasia. However, vaccine-induced protection against H. pylori was only associated with cell infiltration into the gastric mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Nonresponsiveness to gastric Helicobacter infection did not interfere with vaccination-induced protection. Vaccine-induced protective immunity against H. pylori was linked with the induction of cellular infiltration, but importantly not atrophic gastritis.},

We examined the protective effect of systemic vaccination with adjuvant-free formalin-fixed Helicobacter pylori or bacterial lysate and the ability of this vaccine to induce protection against heterologous challenge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were vaccinated subcutaneously with H. pylori 11637 lysate or formalin-fixed bacteria, with or without ISCOMATRIX adjuvant, then orally challenged with H. pylori SS1. Serum was taken prior to challenge to examine specific antibody levels induced by the vaccinations, and protection was assessed by colony-forming assay. RESULTS: Vaccination with H. pylori 11637 lysate or formalin-fixed bacteria delivered systemically induced significantly higher levels of Helicobacter-specific serum IgG than the control, unvaccinated group and orally vaccinated group. After heterologous challenge with H. pylori SS1, all vaccinated groups had significantly lower levels of colonization compared with unvaccinated, control mice, regardless of the addition of adjuvant or route of delivery. Protection induced by systemic vaccination with whole bacterial preparations, without the addition of adjuvants, was only associated with a mild cellular infiltration into the gastric mucosa, with no evidence of atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous vaccination using unadjuvanted formalin-fixed H. pylori has the potential to be a simple, cost-effective approach to the development of a Helicobacter vaccine. Importantly, this vaccine was able to induce protection against heterologous challenge, a factor that would be crucial in any human Helicobacter vaccine. Further studies are required to determine mechanisms of protection and to improve protective ability.},

We provide in vivo evidence that the fundamental role of STAT3 signaling in autoimmunity relates to its absolute requirement for generating T(H)17 T cell responses. We show that STAT3 is a master regulator of this pathogenic T cell subtype, acting at multiple levels in vivo, including T(H)17 T cell differentiation and cytokine production, as well as induction of RORgamma t and the IL-23R. Neither naturally occurring T(H)17 cells nor T(H)17-dependent autoimmunity occurs when STAT3 is ablated in CD4 cells. Furthermore, ablation of STAT3 signaling in CD4 cells results in increased T(H)1 responses, indicating that STAT3 signaling skews T(H) responses away from the T(H)1 pathway and toward the T(H)17 pathway. Thus, STAT3 is a candidate target for T(H)17-dependent autoimmune disease immunotherapy that could selectively inhibit pathogenic immune pathways.},

Because H pylori induces T-cell dependent gastric inflammation in adults and T regulatory (Treg) cells suppress T-cell-dependent pathology, we evaluated gastric histopathology and Treg cell responses in H pylori-infected children and adults. METHODS: Gastric tissue from 36 children and 79 adults with abdominal symptoms in Santiago, Chile, was evaluated prospectively for H pylori bacteria and histopathology using the Sydney classification and Treg responses using immunoassay, immunohistochemistry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Eighteen (50\%) of the children and 51 (65\%) of the adults were infected with H pylori. Children and adults were colonized with similar levels of H pylori. However, the level of gastritis in the children was reduced substantially compared with that of the adults (P {$<$} .05). Coincident with reduced gastric inflammation, the number of Treg cells and levels of Treg cytokines (transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta1 and interleukin-10) were increased markedly in the gastric mucosa of H pylori-infected children compared with that of infected adults (P {$<$} .03 and {$<$} .05, respectively). Also, H pylori infection in the children was associated with markedly increased levels of gastric TGF-beta1 and interleukin-10 messenger RNA. Importantly, gastric TGF-beta1 in H pylori-infected children localized predominantly to mucosal CD25(+) and Foxp3(+) cells, indicating a Treg source for the TGF-beta1. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric pathology is reduced and local Treg cell responses are increased in H pylori-infected children compared with infected adults, suggesting that gastric Treg cell responses down-regulate the inflammation and ulceration induced by H pylori in children.},

  abstract = {Infection with cagA-positive Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is associated with the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. The cagA gene product CagA is delivered from the bacterium into the cytoplasm of the bacterium-attached gastric epithelial cell via the type-IV secretion system. Upon membrane localization and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases, translocated CagA functions as a scaffolding adaptor that interacts with a number of host proteins involved in cell signaling in both tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent and -independent manners. Of special interest is the interaction of CagA with the SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase, of which gain-of-function mutations have recently been found in human malignancies. Through the complex formation, SHP-2 is catalytically activated and induces morphological transformation that is associated with increased cell motility. In addition to the perturbation of intracellular signaling, CagA disrupts the apical junctional complex that regulates the cell\textendash cell contact and maintains the integrity of the epithelial structure. These CagA activities may collectively cause cellular dysfunctions that promote accumulation of multiple genetic changes involved in malignant transformation. Further elucidation of host cell signaling targeted by CagA should provide a new paradigm for `bacterial carcinogenesis' and also give insights into general understanding of inflammation-mediated cancers. Clinically, detailed studies on the relationship between structural diversity and degree of pathogenic activity of CagA should make it possible to identify a high-risk group for gastric carcinoma among H. pylori-infected populations through cagA genotyping. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We investigated the associations between gastro-duodenal diseases and polymorphisms of IL17A (rs2275913 G{$>$}A) and IL17F (rs763780 T{$>$}C). METHODS The study was performed in 548 subjects (363 controls and 185 peptic ulcer cases). The multiplex PCR-SSCP method was used to detect gene polymorphisms. RESULTS Overall, number of rs2275913 A allele was significantly associated with an increased risk for peptic ulcer (OR, 1.50; 95\%CI, 1.11-2.01; p=0.0082). The frequency of rs2275913 GA+AA genotype was also significantly higher in ulcer cases than controls (OR, 1.72; 95\%CI, 1.09-2.72; p=0.020). The rs2275913 GA+AA genotype conferred an increased risk for the severity of gastric mucosal atrophy in subjects younger than 60 years (OR, 2.83; 95\%CI, 1.14-7.04; p=0.025). Both atrophy and metaplasia were increased with age in rs2275913 GA+AA genotype. In NSAIDs/aspirin users, number of rs2275913 A allele was associated with an increased risk for a peptic ulcer (OR, 3.98; 95\%CI, 1.48-10.7; p=0.0061). There was no association of rs763780 with the development of peptic ulcer. CONCLUSIONS Our results provide the evidence that rs2275913 is associated with an increased risk for peptic ulcer and the severity of the gastric mucosal atrophy in comparatively younger subjects. In addition, this allele is also associated with the increased risk for peptic ulcer in NSAIDs/aspirin users.},

  abstract = {For analysis and interpretation of data obtained from experimental readouts of gene expression, such as microarrays and RNA-sequencing, log transformation is routinely applied. This is because expression data, like many biological parameters, are strongly skewed. We show here that gene expression levels in multicellular organisms often deviate from simple (log) normal distributions and instead exhibit shouldered or bimodal distributions. Based on a mathematical model and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that many observed distributions can be explained as mixtures of bimodal two-component lognormal models. This is due to the fact that after log-transformation, the resulting distributions display reductions in the first peak rather than increasing overlaps over a wide range of parameter values. By comparing the theoretical results with biological datasets, our findings suggest that the distributions are generally bimodal for single cell types and get obscured by the different cell types that are present in tissue samples. Our analysis thus provides an initial explanation for the various types of expression level distributions that are found for different datasets.

  abstract = {Inhibition of the mutated fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptor tyrosine kinase is a promising therapeutic strategy in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, development of resistance to FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as PKC412A, has been described recently. This observation may have an increasing impact on the duration of response and relapse rates in upcoming clinical trials employing FLT3-TKI. Herein we investigated two representatives of a novel class of FLT3-TKI: Bis(1H-indol-2-yl)methanones. Both compounds effectively induced apoptosis in FLT3-internal tandem duplicate (ITD)-transfected murine myeloid cells and in primary FLT3-ITD positive blasts. Combination of both compounds with chemotherapy revealed synergistic effects in apoptosis assays. The compounds did not show significant toxicity in human bone marrow cells derived from healthy donors. Compound102 overcame resistance to PKC412 within a non-myelotoxic dose-range. Western Blotting experiments of 32D-FLT3-ITD cells showed dose-dependent dephosphorylation of FLT3-ITD and of its downstream targets STAT5, AKT and ERK upon incubation with either compound. In conclusion, bis(1H-indol-2-yl)methanones overcome resistance mediated by FLT3-ITD mutations at position N676 and show strong efficacy in FLT3-ITD-positive cells alone as well as in combination with chemotherapy. We propose that further development of methanone compounds overcoming resistance to currently established FLT3-TKIs is an important step forward to an anticipated need within our future therapeutic algorithm in FLT3-ITD-positive AML.},

We hypothesized that maternal H. pylori status affects the maternal intestinal microbiota of both mother and newborn. In this study, we determine the structure of the fecal microbiota in mothers and neonates according to maternal H. pylori status and delivery mode. We included 22 mothers and H. pylori infection was determined by fecal antigen test. Eleven mothers (50\%) were H. pylori-positive (7 delivering vaginally and 4 by C-section), and 11 were negative (6 delivering vaginally and 5 by C-section). Stool samples were obtained from mothers and infants and the fecal DNA was sequenced. The fecal microbiota from mothers and their babies differed by the maternal H. pylori status, only in vaginal birth, not in C-section delivery. All 22 infants tested negative for fecal H. pylori at 15 days of age, but those born vaginally -and not those by C-section- showed differences in the infant microbiota by maternal H. pylori status (PERMANOVA, p\,=\,0.01), with higher abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Veillonella, in those born to H. pylori-positive mothers. In conclusion, the structure of the infant fecal microbiota is affected by the maternal H. pylori status only in infants born vaginally, suggesting that the effect could be mediated by labor and birth exposures.},

IL-27 also induces T-Bet, a Stat1-dependent gene crucial to Th1 cell commitment. Similarly, IFN-alpha activates Stat1 and Stat3 and T-Bet expression in naive T cells. Induction of T-Bet results in upregulation of IL-12Rbeta2 on naive T cells, which is essential for responsiveness to IL-12 and differentiation to a Th1 phenotype. Both IL-27 and IFN-alpha induce expression of IL-12Rbeta2 in T cells. In contrast, IFN-gamma, which activates Stat1 but not Stat3, induces expression of T-Bet but not IL-12Rbeta2 in naive T cells.

METHODS: In 81 dyspeptic patients, antral and corpus biopsies were taken for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and histology. G3PDH (control) and IL-10 and IL-12 were coamplified in a duplex PCR and the ratios of cytokines to G3PDH were determined. Bacterial ureA and cagA status was determined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: IL-10 mRNA expression in both the antral and corpus mucosa was greater (p {$<$} 0.01) in cagA positive infection than in H pylori negative patients with histologically normal mucosa. No increase in IL-10 mRNA expression was observed in cagA negative infection. Both in the antral and corpus mucosa, IL-12 mRNA expression was greater (p {$<$} 0.05) in cagA positive than in cagA negative infection and uninfected patients with normal gastric mucosa. In cagA positive infection, there was a correlation between IL-10 and IL-12 mRNA expression in both the antral mucosa (r = 0.515, p {$<$} 0.01) and the corpus mucosa (r = 0.6, p {$<$} 0.005). IL-12 mRNA expression in the antral mucosa was significantly more frequent in H pylori positive patients with duodenal ulcer than in those with gastric ulcer or nonulcer dyspepsia. No difference was observed in IL-10 mRNA expression in relation to endoscopic diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: CagA positive H pylori infection is associated with increased IL-10 and IL-12 mRNA expression. The increased expression of IL-12 mRNA in the majority of patients with duodenal ulcer suggests that Th1 responses may predominate and play a role in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulceration.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with a lower risk of chronic autoimmune diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). H.pylori modulates the gastric immune response, decreasing the local inflammatory response to itself. In mice, chronic Salmonellatyphimurium infection induces colitis similar to Crohn's disease, characterized by inflammation, which progresses toward fibrosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether prior H. pylori infection acts at a distance to modulate the immune response of S.typhimurium-induced colitis. METHODS: Mice were infected with the mouse-adapted strain of H. pylori (SS1), followed by infection with S.typhimurium. The effect of H. pylori on colitis was determined by gross pathology, histopathology, cytokine response, and development of fibrosis in the cecum. Gastritis and systemic immune response was measured in response to infection. RESULTS: H.pylori suppresses the Th17 response to S.typhimurium infection in the mouse cecum, but does not alter the Th2 or T-regulatory response or the development of fibrosis. H. pylori infection induces IL-10 in the mesenteric lymph nodes, suggesting an extragastric mechanism for immunomodulation. H. pylori / S.typhimurium coinfection decreases inflammation in both the cecum and the stomach. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a potential mechanism for the negative association between H. pylori and IBD in humans. H. pylori represses the lower gastrointestinal tract Th17 response to bacterially induced colitis via extragastric immunomodulatory effects, illustrating immunological crosstalk between the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.},

We have performed a cross-sectional analysis of the Treg cell signature in Treg-like cells generated under a number of conditions, with or without Foxp3, to delineate the elements that can be ascribed to T cell activation, interleukin-2, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling, or Foxp3 itself. These influences synergized to determine many of the signature's components. Much of the Treg cell signature was not ascribable to Foxp3 because it contained gene clusters that are coregulated with, but not transactivated by, Foxp3. Thus, a higher level of regulation upstream of Foxp3 determines the lineage, distinct from elements downstream of Foxp3 that are essential for its regulatory properties.},

The differential cytokine expression patterns in Th cells suggest a division of labour in the response against a variety of pathogens. Th17 have an important function in the host-defense-response against extracellular pathogens, but they also have become notorious for their role in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and allergic disorders. Animal models of autoimmune disorders have shown that Th17 effector molecules and transcription factors play a crucial role in both development and maintenance of the disease. The discovery of Th17 not only enhanced our insight into these disorders but also placed a Th subset at the interface between the innate and adoptive immune systems with the potential to regulate subsequent immunity against pathogens.},

During the development of EAE, interferon-{$\gamma$} (IFN-{$\gamma$}) and other proinflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord were produced almost exclusively by cells that had produced IL-17 before their conversion by IL-23 ('ex-T(H)17 cells').

Through the use of interleukin 17 (IL-17) fate-reporter mice, we found here that endogenous cells of the TH17 subset of helper T cells in lymphoid organs of naive mice 'preferentially' homed to the intestines and were maintained independently of IL-23. In Peyer's patches, such TH17 cells acquired a follicular helper T cell (TFH cell) phenotype and induced the development of IgA-producing germinal center B cells. Mice deficient in TH17 cells failed to generate antigen-specific IgA responses, which provides evidence that TH17 cells are the crucial subset required for the production of high-affinity T cell-dependent IgA.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori VacA induces multiple effects on susceptible cells, including vacuolation, mitochondrial damage, inhibition of cell growth, and enhanced cyclooxygenase-2 expression. To assess the ability of H. pylori to modulate the production of inflammatory mediators, we examined the mechanisms by which VacA enhanced IL-8 production by promonocytic U937 cells, which demonstrated the greatest VacA-induced IL-8 release of the cells tested. Inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580), ERK1/2 (PD98059), IkappaBalpha ((E)-3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile), Ca(2+) entry (SKF96365), and intracellular Ca(2+) channels (dantrolene) blocked VacA-induced IL-8 production. Furthermore, an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator (BAPTA-AM), which inhibited VacA-activated p38 MAPK, caused a dose-dependent reduction in VacA-induced IL-8 secretion by U937 cells, implying a role for intracellular Ca(2+) in mediating activation of MAPK and the canonical NF-kappaB pathway. VacA stimulated translocation of NF-kappaBp65 to the nucleus, consistent with enhancement of IL-8 expression by activation of the NF-kappaB pathway. In addition, small interfering RNA of activating transcription factor (ATF)-2 or CREB, which is a p38MAPK substrate and binds to the AP-1 site of the IL-8 promoter, inhibited VacA-induced IL-8 production. VacA activated an IL-8 promoter containing an NF-IL-6 site, but not a mutated AP-1 or NF-kappaB site, suggesting direct involvement of the ATF-2/CREB binding region or NF-kappaB-binding regions in VacA-induced IL-8 promoter activation. Thus, in U937 cells, VacA directly increases IL-8 production by activation of the p38 MAPK via intracellular Ca(2+) release, leading to activation of the transcription factors, ATF-2, CREB, and NF-kappaB.},

Eradication of H. pylori by antibiotics is a treatment of choice but may also alter the susceptibility to allergies and other tumor types. Thus, novel diagnostic or prognostic markers are needed which detect early molecular changes in the stomach mucosa during the transition of chronic inflammation to cancer. In our study, we found that the tumor suppressor caveolin-1 (Cav1) is reduced upon infection with H. pylori, and CagA was sufficient but not necessary for this down-regulation. Loss of Cav1 was caused by H. pylori-dependent activation of sterol-responsive element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1), and this event abolished the interaction of Cav1 with p120 RhoGTPase-activating protein/deleted in liver cancer-1 (p120RhoGAP/DLC1), a second bona fide tumor suppressor in gastric tissue. Conclusively, Cav1 and DLC1 may constitute novel molecular markers in the H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa before neoplastic transformation of the epithelium.},

Active caspase-1 processes pro-IL-1{$\beta$} and pro-IL-18 to generate the bioactive cytokines and to initiate pathogen-specific immune responses. Little information is available on caspase-1 and inflammasome activation during infection with the gastric bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori. In this study, we addressed a possible role for caspase-1 and its cytokine substrates in the spontaneous and vaccine-induced control of Helicobacter infection, as well as the development of gastritis and gastric cancer precursor lesions, using a variety of experimental infection, vaccine-induced protection, and gastric disease models. We show that caspase-1 is activated and IL-1{$\beta$} and IL-18 are processed in vitro and in vivo as a consequence of Helicobacter infection. Caspase-1 activation and IL-1 signaling are absolutely required for the efficient control of Helicobacter infection in vaccinated mice. IL-1R(-/-) mice fail to develop protective immunity but are protected against Helicobacter-associated gastritis and gastric preneoplasia as a result of their inability to generate Helicobacter-specific Th1 and Th17 responses. In contrast, IL-18 is dispensable for vaccine-induced protective immunity but essential for preventing excessive T cell-driven immunopathology. IL-18(-/-) animals develop strongly accelerated pathology that is accompanied by unrestricted Th17 responses. In conclusion, we show in this study that the processing and release of a regulatory caspase-1 substrate, IL-18, counteracts the proinflammatory activities of another caspase-1 substrate, IL-1{$\beta$}, thereby balancing control of the infection with the prevention of excessive gastric immunopathology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Immunization against the gastric bacterium Helicobacter pylori could prevent many gastric cancers and other disorders. Most vaccination protocols used in preclinical models are not suitable for humans. New adjuvants and a better understanding of the correlates and requirements for vaccine-induced protection are needed to accelerate development of vaccines for H pylori. METHODS: Vaccine-induced protection against H pylori infection and its local and systemic immunological correlates were assessed in animal models, using cholera toxin or CAF01 as adjuvants. The contribution of B cells, T-helper (Th)-cell subsets, and dendritic cells to H pylori-specific protection were analyzed in mice. RESULTS: Parenteral administration of a whole-cell sonicate, combined with the mycobacterial cell-wall-derived adjuvant CAF01, protected against infection with H pylori and required cell-mediated, but not humoral, immunity. The vaccine-induced control of H pylori was accompanied by Th1 and Th17 responses in the gastric mucosa and in the gut-draining mesenteric lymph nodes; both Th subsets were required for protective immunity against H pylori. The numbers of memory CD4+ T cells and neutrophils in gastric tissue were identified as the best correlates of protection. Systemic depletion of dendritic cells or regulatory T cells during challenge infection significantly increased protection by overriding immunological tolerance mechanisms activated by live H pylori. CONCLUSIONS: Parenteral immunization with a Helicobacter vaccine using a novel mycobacterial adjuvant induces protective immunity against H pylori that is mediated by Th1 and Th17 cells. Tolerance mechanisms mediated by dendritic cells and regulatory T cells impair H pylori clearance and must be overcome to improve immunity.},

  abstract = {Chronic infection with the gastric bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori causes gastric adenocarcinoma in a particularly susceptible fraction of the infected population. The intestinal type of gastric cancer is preceded by a series of preneoplastic lesions that are of immunopathological origin, and that can be recapitulated by experimental infection of C57BL/6 mice with Helicobacter species. Several lines of evidence suggest that specific T cell subsets and/or their signature cytokines contribute to the control of Helicobacter infections on the one hand, and to the associated gastric preneoplastic pathology on the other. Here, we have used virulent H. pylori and H. felis isolates to infect mice that lack {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} T cells due to a targeted deletion of the T cell receptor {$\beta$}-chain, or are deficient for the unique p35 and p19 subunits of the Th1- and Th17-polarizing cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, respectively. We found that {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} T cells are absolutely required for Helicobacter control and for the induction of gastric preneoplastic pathology. In contrast, neither IL-12-dependent Th1 nor IL-23-dependent Th17 cells were essential for controlling the infection; IL-12p35(-/-) and IL-23p19(-/-) mice did not differ significantly from wild type animals with respect to Helicobacter colonization densities. Gastritis and gastric preneoplastic pathology developed to a similar extent in all three strains upon H. felis infection; in the H. pylori infection model, IL-23p19(-/-) mice exhibited significantly less gastritis and precancerous pathology. In summary, the results indicate that neither Th1 nor Th17 cells are by themselves essential for Helicobacter control; the associated gastric pathology is reduced only in the absence of Th17-polarizing IL-23, and only in the H. pylori, but not the H. felis infection model. The results thus suggest the involvement of other, as yet unknown T cell subsets in both processes.},

  abstract = {Appropriate induction of a Th1 immune response is required for effective antimicrobial immunity. However, dysregulated Th1 immune responses after infection may also lead to immunopathology. Thus, cell-mediated immune responses have to be tightly regulated. Upon infection, the production of interleukin (IL)-12, a heterodimeric cytokine composed of a p35 and a p40 subunit, is the dominant factor in Th1 cell development. The recent discovery of novel dimeric cytokines closely related to IL-12 add now to our understanding of cellular immunity and the fine tuning of T cell responses. At the onset of infection, IL-27, a heterodimer composed of the IL-12p40-related protein EBI-3 (Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3) and the IL-12p35-related protein p28 induces the expression of a functional IL-12 receptor in naive CD4+ T cells, making these cells sensitive to IL-12-mediated Th cell development. Later during infection, IL-23, a heterodimer composed of the IL-12p40 subunit and the IL-12p35-related molecule p19, preferentially acts on Th1 effector/memory CD4+ T cells. The IL-12p40 subunit can also form a homodimer, IL-12p80, which act as an IL-12 and IL-23 antagonist by competing at their receptors. This review focuses on these IL-12-related cytokines contributing to fine tuning of T cell responses after infection with intracellular pathogens.},

In addition, amino acid sequences were for IL-23 p19 subunits were also predicted from the stickleback, Fugu and Tetraodon genomes and included in this investigation. The zebrafish IL-23 p19 cDNA consisted of a 66bp 5' UTR, a 249bp 3' UTR and a single open reading frame of 567bp giving a predicted 188 aa IL-23 p19 molecule. Multiple alignment of zebrafish IL-23 p19, with other known IL-23 p19 and IL-12 p35 amino acid sequences revealed areas of amino acid conservation, such as the presence of four predicted {$\alpha$}-helixes, cysteines important for disulphide bond formation and the conservation of a tryptophan known to interact with the receptor. Amino acid homologies and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the relationship of the fish IL-23 p19 subunits with their mammalian homologues. All the teleost fish IL-23 p19 subunits were found to have 4 exons and 3 introns similar to that of human and mouse IL-23 p19 and a limited degree of synteny was found between the organisms for the regions containing the IL-23 p19 genes with only PAB-dependent poly(A)-specific ribonuclease subunit 2 (PAN2) and IL-23 p19 found in the same order on human chromosome 12 and all the fish genomes looked at. Lastly using real-time PCR, constitutive expression of IL-12 p40 and IL-23 p19 was observed in the kidney, liver, gut and muscle with IL-12 p40 expression higher than IL-23 p19. As soon as an hour after stimulation with LPS, there was an increase of IL-23 p19 in zebrafish leukocytes and an increase of IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-12 p40 and IL-23 p19 expression was found after infection of zebrafish for 1 or 6 days with Mycobaterium marinum strain E11.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori infection is relatively common worldwide and is closely related to gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, chronic gastritis, and stomach ulcers. Therefore, a safe and effective method for preventing H. pylori infection is urgently needed. Given that developing an effective vaccine against H. pylori is one of the best alternatives, H. pylori adhesin Hp0410 was expressed in the food-grade bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus. The recombinant live bacterial vaccine was then used to orally vaccinate mice, and the immunoprotective effects of Hp0410-producing strains were investigated. H. pylori colonization in the stomach of mice immunized with the recombinant L. acidophilus was significantly reduced, in comparison with that in control groups. Furthermore, mucosal secretory IgA antibodies were elicited in the mucosal tissue of mice immunized with the recombinant bacteria, and specific anti-Hp0410 IgG responses were also detected in mouse serum. There was a significant increase in the level of protection against gastric Helicobacter infection following a challenge with H. pylori Sydney strain 1 (SS1). Our results collectively indicate that adhesin Hp0410 is a promising candidate vaccine antigen, and recombinant L. acidophilus expressing Hp0410 is likely to constitute an effective, low-cost, live bacterial vaccine against H. pylori.},

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate changes in the global prevalence of H pylori infection. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for studies of the prevalence of H pylori infection published from January 1, 1970 through January 1, 2016. We analyzed data based on United Nations geoscheme regions and individual countries. We used a random effects model to calculate pooled prevalence estimates~with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), weighted by study size. We extrapolated 2015 prevalence estimates to obtain the~estimated number of individuals with H pylori infection. RESULTS: Among 14,006 reports screened, we identified 263 full-text articles on the prevalence of H pylori infection; 184 were included in the final analysis, comprising data from 62 countries. Africa had the highest pooled prevalence of H pylori infection (70.1\%; 95\% CI, 62.6-77.7), whereas Oceania had the lowest prevalence (24.4\%; 95\% CI, 18.5-30.4). Among individual countries, the prevalence of H~pylori infection varied from as low as 18.9\% in Switzerland (95\% CI, 13.1-24.7) to 87.7\% in Nigeria (95\% CI, 83.1-92.2). Based on regional prevalence estimates, there were approximately 4.4 billion individuals with H pylori infection worldwide in~2015. CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of H pylori infection worldwide, we observed large amounts of variation among regions-more than half the world's population is infected. These data can be used in development of customized strategies for the global eradication.},

METHODS: Barrier-maintained BALB/c mice were infected with H. felis and treated with different antibacterial therapies. H. felis status was determined by bacterial culture, urease test, and bacterial and histologic stainings. Release of prostaglandin E2 from the gastric mucosa was measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: All triple-treated mice were cleared of bacteria both 24 h and 1 month after treatment. However, tinidazole alone also resulted in 100\% eradication. Monotherapies with erythromycin acistrate, tetracycline, colloidal bismuth subcitrate, and nitecapone failed to eradicate the bacteria. The release of gastric prostaglandin E2 was doubled in the infected mice (554 +/- 39, mean +/- SE) compared with the noninfected mice (270 +/- 35) (p {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The H. felis mouse model proved satisfactory for assessing both anti-Helicobacter therapies and the prostaglandin E2 release. The reliability of this method was improved when several methods to assess the H. felis status were used in parallel.},

METHODS: H pylori-specific pathogen-free (SPF) monkeys were experimentally challenged with wild-type (WT) H pylori strain J166 (J166WT, n = 4) or its cag PAI isogenic knockout (J166Deltacag PAI, n = 4). Animals underwent endoscopy before and 1, 4, 8, and 13 weeks after challenge. Gastric biopsies were collected for quantitative culture, histopathology, and host gene expression analysis. RESULTS: Quantitative cultures showed that all experimentally challenged animals were infected with J166WT or its isogenic J166Deltacag PAI. Histopathology demonstrated that inflammation and expansion of the lamina propria were attenuated in animals infected with J166Deltacag PAI compared with J166WT. Microarray analysis showed that of the 119 up-regulated genes in the J166WT-infected animals, several encode innate antimicrobial effector proteins, including elafin, siderocalin, DMBT1, DUOX2, and several novel paralogues of human-beta defensin-2. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that high-level induction of each of these genes depended on the presence of the cag PAI. Immunohistochemistry confirmed increased human-beta defensin-2 epithelial cell staining in animals challenged with J166WT compared with either J166Deltacag PAI-challenged or uninfected control animals. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that one function of the cag PAI is to induce an antimicrobial host response that may serve to increase the competitive advantage of H pylori in the gastric niche and could even provide a protective benefit to the host.},

In elucidating the underlying regulatory network, we uncovered a prominent role for the TNF-{$\alpha$}/NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway in activating IL23A transcription. Moreover, the activating effect of TNF-{$\alpha$} was markedly augmented by the infection of Helicobacter pylori, the primary cause of human gastritis. Of note, H. pylori utilized the CagA/SHP2 pathway to activate IL23A, as well as the induction of the NOD1 pathway by iE-DAP. Importantly, RUNX3 synergized strongly with these physiologically relevant stimuli to induce IL23A.

It has been suggested that T helper cells contribute to the gastric inflammatory response during infection, and that T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 17 (Th17) subsets may be required for control of H. pylori colonization in the stomach. The relative contributions of these subsets to gastritis and control of infection are still under investigation. IL-23 plays a role in stabilizing and expanding Th17 cell cytokine expression. Expression of IL-23, which is induced in dendritic cells and macrophages following co-culture with H. pylori, has also been reported to increase during H. pylori infection in humans and animal models. To investigate the role of IL-23 in H. pylori, we infected IL-23p19 deficient mice (IL-23-/-) and wild-type littermates with H. pylori strain SS1. At various time points post-infection, we assessed colonization, gastric inflammation, and cytokine profiles in the gastric tissue. Specifically, H. pylori-infected IL-23-/- mice have higher levels of H. pylori in their stomachs, significantly less chronic gastritis, and reduced expression of IL-17 and IFN{$\gamma$} compared to H. pylori-infected wild-type mice. While many of these differences were significant, the H. pylori infected IL-23-/- had mild increases in our measurements of disease severity. Our results indicate that IL-23 plays a role in the activation of the immune response and induction of gastritis in response to H. pylori by contributing to the control of infection and severity of gastritis.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori infection leads to an inflammatory response in 100\% of infected individuals. The inflammatory cells which are recruited to the gastric mucosa during infection produce several pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines including several cytokines in the interleukin-17 family. The anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 25 (IL-25, also known as IL-17E), signals through a receptor, which is a heterotrimeric receptor comprised of two IL-17 receptor A subunits and an IL-17 receptor B subunit. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that IL-17RA is required to control infection with Helicobacter pylori in the mouse model. Moreover, the absence of IL-17 receptor A leads to a significant B cell infiltrate and a remarkable increase in lymphoid follicle formation in response to infection compared to infection in wild-type mice. We hypothesized that IL-25, which requires both IL-17 receptor A and IL-17 receptor B for signaling, may play a role in control of inflammation in the mouse model of Helicobacter pylori infection. IL-17 receptor B deficient mice, IL-17 receptor A deficient mice and wild-type mice were infected with Helicobacter pylori (strains SS1 and PMSS1). At several time points H. pylori-infected mice were sacrificed to investigate their ability to control infection and inflammation. Moreover, the effects of IL-17 receptor B deficiency on T helper cytokine expression and H. pylori- specific serum antibody responses were measured. IL-17 receptor B-/- mice (unlike IL-17 receptor A-/- mice) exhibited similar or modest changes in gastric colonization, inflammation, and Th1 and Th17 helper cytokine responses to wild-type mice infected with Helicobacter pylori. However, H. pylori-infected IL-17 receptor B-/- mice have reduced expression of IL-4 and lower serum IgG1 and IgG2a levels compared to infected IL-17 receptor A-/- and wild-type mice. These data indicate that signaling through the IL-17 receptor B subunit is not necessary for control of Helicobacter pylori in our model.},

In this study, we analyzed the structural integrity and activity of oligomeric HtrA from Hp under stress conditions. Examining different parameters, HtrA oligomers were investigated by casein zymography and HtrA activity was further analyzed in in vitro cleavage assays using E-cadherin as a substrate. HtrA showed temperature-dependent disintegration of oligomers. Denaturing agents targeting hydrogen bonds within HtrA destabilized HtrA oligomers while reducing agents disrupting disulfide bonds had no effect. Optimal proteolytic activity was dependent on a neutral pH; however, addition of mono- and divalent salts or reducing agents did not interfere with proteolytic activity. These data indicate the HtrA is active under stress conditions which might support Hp colonizing in the gastric environment.},

For this purpose, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were treated with or without HpHSP60 in the presence of an anti-CD3 mAb to determine the effect of HpHSP60 on cell proliferation. In this report, HpHSP60 decreased the expression of CDK4 to significantly arrest the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated T-cells, which correlated with the induction of Treg cells. Moreover, monocytic cells were essential for the induction of HpHSP60-induced Treg cells via the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-{$\beta$} after treatment with HpHSP60. Blockage of HpHSP60 with specific monoclonal antibodies significantly reduced the colonization of H. pylori and the expression of Treg cells in vivo.

METHODS: Adult patients with H.~pylori-related gastritis were treated with 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy. Fecal samples were collected before treatment at week 2, week 8, and week 48. Nucleic acid extraction from fecal samples was performed. The V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced with the MiSeq followed by data analysis using Qiime pipeline. RESULTS: Eleven patients received complete follow-up. Before treatment, the most abundant phyla were Firmicutes (45.3\%), Bacteroidetes (24.3\%), Proteobacteria (9.9\%), and Actinobacteria (5.0\%). At the end of bismuth therapy, the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria decreased to 0.5\% (P~{$<~$}.001) and 1.3\% (P~=~.038), respectively.

At week 8, the relative abundances of all phyla restored to the levels at baseline. The relative abundances of all phyla at week 48 also did not significantly differ from those at baseline. During eradication therapy, 6 patients (55\%) reported at least 1 adverse event. The relative abundance of phylum Proteobacteria in patients with adverse effects was more than that in patients without adverse effects (68.7\%~{$\pm~$}8.8\% vs 43.4\%~{$\pm~$}25.5\%; P~=~.048). CONCLUSIONS: Bismuth quadruple therapy for H.~pylori eradication can lead to short-term dysbiosis of gut microbiota. The increase in Proteobacteria in gut microbiota may attribute to the development of adverse effects during bismuth quadruple therapy.},

Here we show that IL-17 can promote autoimmune disease through a mechanism distinct from its proinflammatory effects. As compared with wild-type mice, autoimmune BXD2 mice express more IL-17 and show spontaneous development of germinal centers (GCs) before they increase production of pathogenic autoantibodies. We show that blocking IL-17 signaling disrupts CD4+ T cell and B cell interactions required for the formation of GCs and that mice lacking the IL-17 receptor have reduced GC B cell development and humoral responses. Production of IL-17 correlates with upregulated expression of the genes Rgs13 and Rgs16, which encode regulators of G-protein signaling, and results in suppression of the B cell chemotactic response to the chemokine CXCL12. These findings suggest a mechanism by which IL-17 drives autoimmune responses by promoting the formation of spontaneous GCs.},

Therefore, we investigated the relationship of IL-12 and IL-27 gene polymorphisms and CRC. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed polymorphisms of IL-12 gene 16974 A/C and IL-27 gene -964 A/G, 2905 T/G, 4730 T/C in 410 patients with CRC and 450 controls, using PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of IL-12 and IL-27 gene polymorphisms between the group of patients with CRC and the controls. Furthermore, no association was found between IL-12 family gene polymorphisms and different clinical stages in patients with CRC. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that IL-12 and IL-27 gene polymorphisms may not be involved in susceptibility to CRC.},

Here, we investigate the capacity of IL-27, a cytokine with pro- and anti-inflammatory properties, to regulate the generation of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-inducible forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)-positive regulatory T (Treg) cells. Our results demonstrate that IL-27 inhibits the acquisition of the Treg phenotype at the level of Foxp3, CD25 and CTLA-4 (CD152) expression as well as the suppressive function. In contrast to TGFbeta-induced Treg cells, the cells generated after differentiation in the presence of TGFbeta and IL-27 maintained the ability for IL-2 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) production. The inhibitory effect of IL-27 on Treg generation was at least partially signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) dependent as examined by targeted STAT3 protein inhibition using small interfering RNA (siRNA), while STAT1-dependent signals seemed to oppose the STAT3 signals. In turn, TGFbeta blocked IL-27-induced T(h)1 differentiation. Thus, IL-27 and TGFbeta mutually control their effects on CD4+ T-cell differentiation, whereby IL-27 favours inflammatory conditions through a STAT3-dependent inhibition of Treg generation.},

Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from corresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between {$\pm$}1.},

Consequently, dPCR has the potential to have a substantial impact on research as well as diagnostic applications. However, as with qPCR, the ability to perform robust meaningful experiments requires careful design and adequate controls. To assist independent evaluation of experimental data, comprehensive disclosure of all relevant experimental details is required. To facilitate this process we present the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Digital PCR Experiments guidelines. This report addresses known requirements for dPCR that have already been identified during this early stage of its development and commercial implementation. Adoption of these guidelines by the scientific community will help to standardize experimental protocols, maximize efficient utilization of resources, and enhance the impact of this promising new technology.},

Benefits of this procedure over conventional methods for measuring RNA include its sensitivity, large dynamic range, the potential for high throughout as well as accurate quantification. To achieve this, however, appropriate normalisation strategies are required to control for experimental error introduced during the multistage process required to extract and process the RNA. There are many strategies that can be chosen; these include normalisation to sample size, total RNA and the popular practice of measuring an internal reference or housekeeping gene. However, these methods are frequently applied without appropriate validation. In this review we discuss the relative merits of different normalisation strategies and suggest a method of validation that will enable the measurement of biologically meaningful results.},

Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) combined with stable isotope dilution has emerged as a promising option to speed this step, particularly because of its multiplexing capacities. However, analytical variabilities because of upstream sample handling or incomplete trypsin digestion still need to be resolved. In 2007, we developed the PSAQ\texttrademark{} method (Protein Standard Absolute Quantification), which uses full-length isotope-labeled protein standards to quantify target proteins. In the present study we used clinically validated cardiovascular biomarkers (LDH-B, CKMB, myoglobin, and troponin I) to demonstrate that the combination of PSAQ and SRM (PSAQ-SRM) allows highly accurate biomarker quantification in serum samples. A multiplex PSAQ-SRM assay was used to quantify these biomarkers in clinical samples from myocardial infarction patients. Good correlation between PSAQ-SRM and ELISA assay results was found and demonstrated the consistency between these analytical approaches. Thus, PSAQ-SRM has the capacity to improve both accuracy and reproducibility in protein analysis. This will be a major contribution to efficient biomarker development strategies.},

METHODS: The dupA locus of 34 strains was sequenced. A panel of dupA mutants was generated and cocultured with human gastric epithelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells; proinflammatory cytokine release was measured. IL8 expression was measured in human gastric biopsy specimens and related to the dupA and cagA status of infecting strains. RESULTS: Most H. pylori strains had a dupA allele that was longer (1884 bp; dupA1) than previously described dupA alleles, although some had truncated versions (dupA2). Unlike the best-characterized H. pylori virulence determinant, the cag pathogenicity island (cag PaI), neither dupA type induced release of interleukin (IL)-8 from gastric epithelial cells. However, infections due to dupA-positive strains were associated with higher-level mucosal IL-8 messenger RNA expression in the human stomach than were infections due to dupA-negative strains. To explain this paradox, we found that dupA1 (but not dupA2 or the cag PaI) substantially increased H. pylori-induced IL-12p40 and IL-12p70 production from CD14(+) mononuclear cells. Other T helper 1-associated cytokines were also modestly induced. CONCLUSION: We suggest that virulent H. pylori strains cause inflammation by stimulating epithelial cells through cag-encoded proteins and mononuclear inflammatory cells through dupA1 products.},

We generated two MV vectors expressing secretory NAP forms: MV-lambda-NAP encoding the full-length constant lambda light chain domain and MV-s-NAP encoding only the N-terminus of the lambda light chain with the leader peptide. Immunization of MV permissive Ifnarko-CD46Ge transgenic mice by a single intraperitoneal injection of the NAP-expressing strains induced a robust, long-term humoral and cellular immune response against MV. Nine months post vaccination measles-neutralizing antibody titers were above the serum level considered protective for humans. Furthermore, all animals immunized with MV strains expressing the secretory NAP antigen developed strong humoral immunity against NAP, reaching titers {$>$}1:10,000 within 2-4 weeks. IFN-{$\gamma$} ELISpot assay confirmed that NAP-encoding MV vectors can also stimulate NAP-specific cell-mediated immunity. Our data demonstrate that MV is an excellent vector platform for expression of bacterial antigens and development of vaccines for H. pylori immunoprophylaxis in humans.},

  abstract = {Therapeutic management of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) remains an unsolved issue. Indeed, no therapeutic regimen is able to cure the infection in all treated patients, and in many the infection persists despite the administration of several consecutive standard therapies. Although antibiotic resistance reports describe alarming results, the outcome of therapeutic regimens does not seem to parallel this scenario in most cases, since a successful performance is often reached in more than 80\% of cases. However, the phenomenon of increasing antibiotic resistance is being closely studied, and the results show controversial aspects even in the same geographic area. For the continents of Europe, America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, minimal and maximal values of resistance to the main antibiotics (clarithromycin, amoxicillin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin) feature wide ranges in different countries. The real enigma is therefore linked to the several different therapeutic regimens, which show results that often do not parallel the in vitro findings even in the same areas. A first aspect to be emphasized is that some regimens are limited by their use in very small geographic districts. Moreover, not all therapeutic trials have considered bacterial and host factors affecting the therapeutic outcome. The additional use of probiotics may help to reduce adverse events, but their therapeutic impact is doubtful. In conclusion, the "ideal therapy", paradoxically, appears to be a "utopia", despite the unprecedented volume of studies in the field and the real breakthrough in medical practice made by the discovery and treatment of H. pylori. The ample discrepancies observed in the different areas do not encourage the development of therapeutic guidelines that could be valid worldwide. On these bases, one of the main challenges for the future might be identifying a successful solution to overcome antibiotic resistances. In this context, geography must be considered a relevant matter.},

Research in rodent models supported by data from human tissue demonstrated that the host immune response to H. pylori is limited by host regulatory T cells. Immunization has been shown to induce a potent Th1- and Th17-mediated immune response capable of eradicating or at least significantly reducing the bacterial load of H. pylori in the stomach in small animal models. These results have not translated well to humans. Clinical trials employing many of the strategies used in rodents for oral immunization including the use of a mucosal adjuvant such as Escherichia coli LT or delivery by attenuated enteric bacteria have failed to limit H. pylori infection and have highlighted the potential toxicity of exotoxin-based mucosal adjuvants. A recent study, however, utilizing a recombinant fusion protein of H. pylori urease and the subunit B of E. coli LT, was performed on over 4000 children. Efficacy of over 70\% was demonstrated against naturally acquired infection compared to control volunteers one year post-immunization. Efficacy was reduced, but still above 50\% at three years. This study provided new insight into the strategies for developing an improved vaccine for widespread use in countries with high infection rates and where gastric cancer (GC) remains one of the most common causes of death due to cancer.},

The aim of our study was to compare gastritis staging and interobserver agreement between general and expert gastrointestinal (GI) pathologists using Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment (OLGA) and Operative Link on Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia (OLGIM). We enrolled 835 patients undergoing upper endoscopy in the study. Two general and two expert gastrointestinal pathologists graded biopsy specimens according to the Sydney classification, and the stage of gastritis was assessed by OLGA and OLGIM system. Using OLGA, 280 (33.4~\%) patients had gastritis (stage I-IV), whereas with OLGIM this was 167 (19.9~\%). OLGA stage III- IV gastritis was observed in 25 patients, whereas by OLGIM stage III-IV was found in 23 patients. Interobserver agreement between expert GI pathologists for atrophy in the antrum, incisura angularis, and corpus was moderate (kappa\,=\,0.53, 0.57 and 0.41, respectively, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001), but almost perfect for intestinal metaplasia (kappa\,=\,0.82, 0.80 and 0.81, respectively, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). However, interobserver agreement between general pathologists was poor for atrophy, but moderate for intestinal metaplasia. OLGIM staging provided the highest interobserver agreement, but a substantial proportion of potentially high-risk individuals would be missed if only OLGIM staging is applied. Therefore, we recommend to use a combination of OLGA and OLGIM for staging of chronic gastritis.},

In contrast, both IL-17F and IL-17A were involved in host defense against mucoepithelial infection by Staphylococcus aureus and Citrobacter rodentium. IL-17A was produced mainly in T cells, whereas IL-17F was produced in T cells, innate immune cells, and epithelial cells. Although only IL-17A efficiently induced cytokines in macrophages, both cytokines activated epithelial innate immune responses. These observations indicate that IL-17A and IL-17F have overlapping yet distinct roles in host immune and defense mechanisms.},

To more fully ascertain the extent of H. pylori genetic diversity within the ecological niche of its natural host, we harvested additional isolates of the sequenced H. pylori strain J99 from its human source patient after a 6-year interval. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR and DNA sequencing of four unlinked loci indicated that these isolates were closely related to the original strain. In contrast, microarray analysis revealed differences in genetic content among all of the isolates that were not detected by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR or sequence analysis. Several ORFs from loci scattered throughout the chromosome in the archival strain did not hybridize with DNA from the recent strains, including multiple ORFs within the J99 plasticity zone. In addition, DNA from the recent isolates hybridized with probes for ORFs specific for the other fully sequenced H. pylori strain 26695, including a putative traG homolog. Among the additional J99 isolates, patterns of genetic diversity were distinct both when compared with each other and to the original prototype isolate. These results indicate that within an apparently homogeneous population, as determined by macroscale comparison and nucleotide sequence analysis, remarkable genetic differences exist among single-colony isolates of H. pylori. Direct evidence that H. pylori has the capacity to lose and possibly acquire exogenous DNA is consistent with a model of continuous microevolution within its cognate host.},

Recent in vitro studies indicate that this cytokine stimulates a unique subset of CD4 cells, the T helper cell (Th)17 subset, to produce and release the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17. However, it has not been known whether this is an action of IL-23 per se that has bearing for the early innate response in lungs in vivo and whether there is an IL-23\textendash responsive population of IL-17\textendash producing CD4 cells in the bronchoalveolar space. We now present evidence that IL-23 can be involved in the early innate response to both gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial products in the lungs: Recombinant IL-23 protein per se accumulates inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar space in part via endogenous production of IL-17, and this IL-17 production occurs locally in IL-23\textendash responsive CD4 cells. This IL-17 response to IL-23 occurs without any pronounced impact on Th1/Th2 polarization. Moreover, recombinant IL-23 protein increases the local MMP-9 activity, which is generated by neutrophils mainly. CD4 cells in the lungs may thus respond to IL-23 from antigen-presenting cells exposed to gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens and thereby reinforce the early innate response. These findings support that IL-23 and IL-17 form a functionally relevant ``immunological axis'' in the lungs in vivo.},

We show here that colonization of the small intestine of mice with a single commensal microbe, segmented filamentous bacterium (SFB), is sufficient to induce the appearance of CD4(+) T helper cells that produce IL-17 and IL-22 (Th17 cells) in the lamina propria. SFB adhere tightly to the surface of epithelial cells in the terminal ileum of mice with Th17 cells but are absent from mice that have few Th17 cells. Colonization with SFB was correlated with increased expression of genes associated with inflammation and antimicrobial defenses and resulted in enhanced resistance to the intestinal pathogen Citrobacter rodentium.

RORgammat induces transcription of the genes encoding IL-17 and the related cytokine IL-17F in na\"ive CD4(+) T helper cells and is required for their expression in response to IL-6 and TGF-beta, the cytokines known to induce IL-17. Th17 cells are constitutively present throughout the intestinal lamina propria, express RORgammat, and are absent in mice deficient for RORgammat or IL-6. Mice with RORgammat-deficient T cells have attenuated autoimmune disease and lack tissue-infiltrating Th17 cells.

  abstract = {Protein glycosylation was once considered as an eccentricity of a few bacteria. However in the recent years multiple O-glycosylation mechanisms have been identified in bacterial species from the most diverse genera, including various important human pathogens. This review focuses on summarizing the structural diversity, the various pathways and the physiological roles of this post-translational protein modification. We propose a classification of O-glycosylation based on the requirement of an oligosaccharyltransferase (OTase). OTase-dependent glycosylation utilizes an oligosaccharide synthesized on a lipid carrier that is transferred to proteins en bloc by an OTase. Multiple proteins, including the pilins, are glycosylated using this mechanism. OTase-independent glycosylation refers to the pathway in which glycosyltransferases sequentially add monosaccharides onto the target proteins. This pathway is employed for glycosylation of flagella and autotransporters. Both systems play key roles in pathogenesis. Exploiting glycosylation machineries it is now possible to generate glycoconjugates made of different proteins attached to polysaccharides derived from LPS or capsule biosynthesis. These recombinant glycoproteins can be exploited for vaccines and diagnostics of bacterial infections. Furthermore, O-glycosylation systems are promising targets for antibiotic development. Technological advances in MS and NMR will facilitate the discovery of novel glycosylation systems. Likely, the O-glycosylation pathways we currently know constitute just the tip of the iceberg of a still largely uncharacterized bacterial glycosylation world.},

Dysregulation of IL-10 is associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, and so, understanding the mechanisms by which IL-10 gene expression is regulated remains an important area of study. Macrophages represent a major source of IL-10, which is generated in response to TLR signaling as a feedback mechanism to curtail inflammatory response. In this study, we identify a signaling pathway in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages in which activation of TLR4 by LPS induces the expression of IL-10 through the sequential induction of type I IFNs followed by induction and signaling through IL-27. We demonstrate that IL-27 signaling is required for robust IL-10 induction by LPS and type I IFNs. IL-27 leads directly to transcription of IL-10 through the activation of two required transcription factors, STAT1 and STAT3, which are recruited to the IL-10 promoter. Finally, through systematic functional promoter-reporter analysis, we identify three cis elements within the proximal IL-10 promoter that play an important role in regulating transcription of IL-10 in response to IL-27.},

It orchestrates innate and T cell-mediated inflammatory pathways and can promote T helper 17 (Th17) cell responses. Utilizing a T cell transfer model, we showed that IL-23-dependent colitis did not require IL-17 secretion by T cells. Furthermore, IL-23-independent intestinal inflammation could develop if immunosuppressive pathways were reduced. The frequency of naive T cell-derived Foxp3+ cells in the colon increased in the absence of IL-23, indicating a role for IL-23 in controlling regulatory T cell induction. Foxp3-deficient T cells induced colitis when transferred into recipients lacking IL-23p19, showing that IL-23 was not essential for intestinal inflammation in the absence of Foxp3. Taken together, our data indicate that overriding immunosuppressive pathways is an important function of IL-23 in the intestine and could influence not only Th17 cell activity but also other types of immune responses.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the virulence factor CagA with IL-17 and IL-23 serum levels in duodenal ulcer (DU) patients and H. pylori-infected asymptomatic (AS) carriers. METHODS In total, 45 H. pylori-infected DU patients were enrolled to study: 23 tested positive for the anti-CagA antibody (anti-CagA+) and 22 tested negative for the anti-CagA antibody (anti-CagA-), 30 were AS carriers (15 were anti-CagA+ and 15 were anti-CagA-) and 15 were healthy uninfected participants (as a control group). The IL-17 and IL-23 serum levels of participants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. RESULTS The mean IL-17 levels in DU patients were significantly higher than those in AS and control groups (P {$<$} 0.001 and P {$<$} 0.0001 respectively). In the DU group, the mean IL-17 levels in participants testing positive for anti-CagA (10.84 +/- 5.79 pg/mL) were significantly higher than those observed in participants testing negative for anti-CagA (7.65 +/- 4.74 pg/mL; P {$<$} 0.05). The mean IL-23 levels in the DU and AS groups were significantly higher than in the control group (P {$<$} 0.02 and P {$<$} 0.03 respectively) but were not significantly different in participants testing positive and negative for anti-CagA. CONCLUSION These results showed higher IL-17 and IL-23 serum levels in H. pylori-infected participants than in the control group.

Helicobacter pylori infection is an established risk factor for gastric cancer and the organism has recently been classified as a group I carcinogen by an IARC working group. In this study, we describe differences in gastric epithelial cell proliferation between a H. pylori eradicated group (n = 21) and a not eradicated group (n = 8) after anti-H. pylori eradication therapy to show that increased cell proliferation is associated with H. pylori infection. H. pylori infection was determined by rapid urease test and immunohistochemical method with anti-H. pylori polyclonal antibody. Gastric epithelial cell proliferation was assessed using immunohistochemical method using Ki-67 monoclonal antibody. Ki-67 positive cells in H. pylori associated chronic active gastritis were observed in the glandular neck and the upper portion of foveolar epithelium. Patients who cleared their H. pylori infections showed a significant decrease of Ki-67 labeling index after therapy (0.73 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.48 +/- 0.08, p {$<$} 0.01). By contrast, Ki-67 labeling index before and after treatment in patients who remained positive for H. pylori showed no significant difference (0.78 +/- 0.08 vs 0.74 +/- 0.10, p {$>$} 0.05). These results indicate that H. pylori infection increases the proliferation of gastric foveolar epithelium, which is reduced by the eradication therapy. We suggest that anti-H. pylori eradication therapy can prevent mucosal cell proliferation to be closely associated with gastric carcinogenesis.},

  abstract = {Inflammation is an important environmental factor that promotes tumourigenesis and the progression of established cancerous lesions, and recent studies have started to dissect the mechanisms linking the two pathologies. These inflammatory and infectious conditions trigger immune and stromal cell release of soluble mediators which facilitate survival and proliferation of tumour cells in a paracrine manner. In addition, (epi-)genetic mutations affecting oncogenes, tumour-suppressor genes, chromosomal rearrangements and amplifications trigger the release of inflammatory mediators within the tumour microenvironment to promote neoplastic growth in an autocrine manner. These two pathways converge in tumour cells and result in activation of the latent signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) which mediates a transcriptional response favouring survival, proliferation and angiogenesis. The abundance of cytokines that activate Stat3 within the tumour microenvironment, which comprises of members of the interleukin (IL) IL6, IL10 and IL17/23 families, underpins a signaling network that simultaneously promotes the growth of neoplastic epithelium, fuels inflammation and suppresses the host's anti-tumour immune response. Accordingly, aberrant and persistent Stat3 activation is a frequent observation in human cancers of epithelial origin and is often associated with poor outcome.Here we summarize insights gained from mice harbouring mutations in components of the Stat3 signaling cascade and in particular of gp130, the shared receptor for the IL6 family of cytokines. We focus on the various feed-back and feed-forward loops in which Stat3 provides the signaling node in cells of the tumour and its microenvironment thereby functionally linking excessive inflammation to neoplastic growth. Although these observations are particularly pertinent to gastrointestinal tumours, we suggest that the tumour's addiction to persistent Stat3 activation is likely to also impact on other epithelial cell-derived cancers. These insights provide clues to the judicious interference of the gp130/Stat3 signaling cascade in therapeutically targeting cancer.},

  abstract = {Vaccines against Helicobacter pylori could circumvent the problem of increasing antibiotic resistance. They would be particularly useful in developing countries, where re-infection rates are high following standard eradication regimes. The Mongolian gerbil is a good model for H. pylori infection, as the gastric pathology induced by infection is similar to that in humans. The H. pylori-induced inflammatory response in gerbils is considerably greater than in murine models. The aim of this study was to determine if gerbils could be vaccinated against H. pylori. Mongolian gerbils were vaccinated orally with an H. pylori whole cell sonicate preparation and cholera toxin adjuvant. Vaccinated gerbils and controls were challenged with the autologous H. pylori strain 42GX. All infection, and cholera toxin, control gerbils were H. pylori positive 6 weeks post-challenge. By contrast, a significant degree of protection was demonstrated in vaccinated gerbils. Only two of 10 of gerbils were H. pylori positive (P{$<$}0.001). Protection was associated with increased serum H. pylori IgG antibodies. Protected gerbils had histologically normal gastric mucosa and, in contrast to mice, no post-immunisation gastritis was evident. In the control groups, the degree of inflammation was variable, with some of the animals having corpus gastritis and corpus mucous metaplasia. The levels of gastric IL-12p40 and IFNgamma transcripts were significantly decreased in vaccinated animals compared to infection and cholera toxin controls (P{$<$}0.01). Gastric IL-10 and TGFbeta transcripts were found only at relatively low levels. These results demonstrate that Mongolian gerbils can be successfully vaccinated against H. pylori and protected from H. pylori-induced pathology.},

An impaired gastric mucosal barrier could be involved in this carcinogenesis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate laser confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) for in vivo functional imaging of mucosal barrier defects in patients with IM. DESIGN: Prospective, controlled study. SETTING: A tertiary-care academic center. PATIENTS: This study involved patients with IM of the gastric mucosa who underwent CLE for surveillance. INTERVENTIONS: Specific IM mucosa and non-IM mucosa in patients were identified by CLE, and targeted biopsy samples were taken for histopathology and electron microscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Post-CLE assessment of paracellular fluorescein leakage was devised and validated by electron microscopy. We also evaluated the effect of H pylori eradication on the mucosal barrier. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were included. Of non-IM samples, the paracellular permeability was significantly increased in H pylori-positive samples compared with H pylori-negative controls (54 {$\pm$} 31\% vs 3 {$\pm$} 6\%, P {$<$} .05). Of IM samples, the permeability was significantly increased in both H pylori-negative and H pylori-positive samples (67 {$\pm$} 34\% and 72 {$\pm$} 28\% vs 3 {$\pm$} 6\%, both P {$<$} .05). The results of post-CLE assessment correlated well with the electron microscopy findings (R(2) 0.834, P {$<$} .0001). After the eradication of H pylori, the paracellular barrier dysfunction of non-IM mucosa was significantly improved as shown by electron microscopy and CLE (both P {$<$} .001). However, there was no significant change in IM mucosa. LIMITATIONS: Single-center study. CONCLUSIONS: CLE allows functional imaging of mucosal barrier defects. Gastric IM is associated with an impaired paracellular barrier irrespective of H pylori eradication.},

Therefore, the clinical guidelines recommend taking antibiotic therapy to eradicate the pathogen, which usually leads to the desired therapeutic effect. However, some failure cases of this therapy indicate that the increasing antibiotic resistance and side effects may affect the therapeutic effect. Here we propose that using probiotics as supplementation for antibiotic therapy may provide an extra help. Recent studies have shown that probiotic supplementation therapy has promising application prospects; it can enhance the antibiotic effect to achieve a better therapeutic result and maintain the balance of the host gastrointestinal microbiota. In summary, under global conditions of increasing H. pylori prevalence, probiotic supplementation therapy is worthy of further studies for future clinical application.},

Specific antibody levels in serum as well as specific antibody levels and antibody-secreting cells in biopsies from antrum and duodenum were determined by ELISA and ELISPOT methods. In contrast to oral vaccination, nasal and rectal vaccination did not induce significant increases in specific antibody-secreting cells either in the antrum or duodenum. Furthermore, when analyzing the antibody levels in saponin extracted biopsies, intrajejunal vaccination was superior to both nasal and rectal vaccination in inducing antigen-specific IgA levels in the stomach. We conclude that oral vaccination is the optimal route for induction of antigen-specific IgA antibody responses in the stomach and duodenum of humans, while nasal or rectal vaccination is less suitable for this purpose.},

In this study, the dimerization interfaces of IL-12 family members were characterized, with emphasis on IL-35. Ebi3 and p35 subunits from human and mouse paired effectively with each other, indicating there is no species barrier to IL-35 dimerization and suggesting a conserved dimerization interface. Specific p35 residues that contribute to formation of the IL-12 interface were assessed for their contribution to the IL-35 interface, and candidate Ebi3 residues were screened for their contribution to both IL-27 and IL-35 interfaces. Several residues were identified as critical to the IL-12 or IL-27 interfaces. Conversely, no single mutation was identified that completely disrupts p35/Ebi3 pairing. Linear alanine scanning mutagenesis on both p35 and Ebi3 subunits was performed, focusing on residues that are conserved between the mouse and human proteins. Additionally, a structure-based alanine-scanning approach in which mutations were clustered based on proximitiy was performed on the p35 subunit. Both approaches suggest that IL-35 has distinct criteria for subunit pairing and is remarkabley less sensitive to structural perturbation than IL-12 and IL-27. Additionally, studies using a panel of anti-p35 and anti-Ebi3 antibodies indicate differential availability of epitopes within IL-12 family members that share these subunits, suggesting that IL-35 has distinct structural features, relative to IL-12 and IL-27. These results may be useful in future directed therapeutic targeting of IL-12 family members.},

Regulatory T (T(reg)) cells prevent systemic and tissue-specific autoimmunity and inflammatory lesions at mucosal interfaces. These cells are generated in the thymus (tT(reg) cells) and in the periphery (induced (i)T(reg) cells), and their dual origin implies a division of labour between tT(reg) and iT(reg) cells in immune homeostasis. Here we show that a highly selective blockage in differentiation of iT(reg) cells in mice did not lead to unprovoked multi-organ autoimmunity, exacerbation of induced tissue-specific autoimmune pathology, or increased pro-inflammatory responses of T helper 1 (T(H)1) and T(H)17 cells. However, mice deficient in iT(reg) cells spontaneously developed pronounced T(H)2-type pathologies at mucosal sites--in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs--with hallmarks of allergic inflammation and asthma. Furthermore, iT(reg)-cell deficiency altered gut microbial communities. These results suggest that whereas T(reg) cells generated in the thymus appear sufficient for control of systemic and tissue-specific autoimmunity, extrathymic differentiation of T(reg) cells affects commensal microbiota composition and serves a distinct, essential function in restraint of allergic-type inflammation at mucosal interfaces.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative flagellate bacterium that infects the stomach of more than half of the global population, is regarded as the leading cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and even gastric adenocarcinoma in some individuals. Although the bacterium induces strong humoral and cellular immune responses, it can persist in the host for decades. It has several virulence factors, some of them having vaccine potential as judged by immunoproteomic analysis. A few vaccination studies involving a small number of infected or uninfected humans with various H. pylori formulations such as the recombinant urease, killed whole cells, and live Salmonella vectors presenting the subunit antigens have not provided satisfactory results. One trial that used the recombinant H. pylori urease coadministered with native Escherichia coli enterotoxin (LT) demonstrated a reduction of H. pylori load in infected participants. Although extensive studies in the mouse model have demonstrated the feasibility of both therapeutic and prophylactic immunizations, the mechanism of vaccine-induced protection is poorly understood as several factors such as immunoglobulin and various cytokines do not contribute to protection. Transcriptome analyses in mice have indicated the role of nonclassical immune factors in vaccine-induced protection. The role of regulatory T cells in the persistence of H. pylori infection has also been suggested. A recently developed experimental H. pylori infection model in humans may be used for testing several new adjuvants and vaccine delivery systems that have been currently obtained. The use of vaccines with appropriate immunogens, routes of immunization, and adjuvants along with a better understanding of the mechanism of immune protection may provide more favorable results.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Helicobacter pylori infection is regarded as the major cause of various gastric diseases and induces the production of several cytokines including interleukin-17 (IL-17) recently recognized as an important player in the mammalian immune system. OBJECTIVE This review deals with the role of IL-17 on the H. pylori-induced infection and immunity in humans and experimental animals. RESULTS H. pylori infection increases IL-17 in the gastric mucosa of humans and experimental animals. In humans, IL-17 induces the secretion of IL-8 by activating the ERK 1/2 MAP kinase pathway and the released IL-8 attracts neutrophils promoting inflammation. IL-23 is increased in patients with H. pylori-related gastritis and regulates IL-17 secretion via STAT3 pathway. Studies in H. pylori-infected mice indicate that IL-17 is primarily associated with gastric inflammation. The early events in the immune response of immunized and challenged mice include the recruitment of T cells and the production of IL-17. Neutrophil attracting chemokines are released, and the bacterial load is considerably reduced. IL-17 plays a dual role in infection and vaccination. In infection, T regulatory cells (Tregs) suppress the inflammatory reaction driven by IL-17 thereby favoring bacterial persistence. Immunization produces Helicobacter-specific memory T-helper cells that can possibly alter the ratio between T-helper 17 and Treg responses so that the IL-17-driven inflammatory reaction can overcome the Treg response leading to bacterial clearance. CONCLUSION IL-17 plays an important role in H. pylori-related gastritis and in the reduction of Helicobacter infection in mice following immunization.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM Recently, it has been shown that serine proteases derived from microorganisms stimulate epithelial cells to produce inflammatory mediators through protease-activated receptor (PAR). We investigated the involvement of PAR2 in the interleukin (IL)-8 production by Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS Human gastric epithelial cells, MKN45 cells, were used. The expression of PAR2 was assessed by real-time PCR and immunocytochemistry, and IL-8 protein was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PAR2 mRNA and protein were constitutively expressed on unstimulated MKN45 cells. The treatment of cells with H. pylori resulted in a significant increase in PAR2 expression. In addition, trypsin (a natural PAR2 agonist), SLIGKV amide (a synthetic PAR2 agonist), H. pylori live bacteria or H. pylori culture supernatant significantly induced IL-8 production from MKN45 cells. H. pylori-induced IL-8 production was inhibited by nafamostat mesilate (a serine protease inhibitor), neutralizing antibody to PAR2 and in PAR2-deficient cells treated with siRNA. CONCLUSIONS These results reveal that H. pylori-derived protease activates gastric epithelial cells to produce inflammatory cytokines through PAR2, suggesting an important role for PAR2 in the modulation of gastric inflammation associated with H. pylori.},

We here show that Cot/Tpl2(-/-) macrophages produce significantly less IL-23, an important regulator of Th17-type response, than the wild-type counterparts in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is a ligand for TLR4. The decreased IL-23 production in Cot/Tpl2(-/-) macrophages is, at least partly, regulated at the transcriptional level, as the LPS-mediated IL-23 p19 mRNA induction was significantly less in Cot/Tpl2(-/-) macrophages. Chemical inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity similarly inhibited IL-23 expression in LPS-stimulated wild-type macrophages. As Cot/Tpl2 is an essential upstream component of the ERK activation pathway of LPS, it is suggested that Cot/Tpl2 positively regulates IL-23 expression through ERK activation. These results indicate that Cot/Tpl2 may be involved in balancing Th1/Th17 differentiation by regulating the expression ratio of IL-12 and IL-23 in APCs.},

METHODS: A gastric biopsy-based qPCR for the detection of H pylori infection and the identification of clarithromycin-resistant strains in children was evaluated in 62 children with infection and 341 children without infection. H pylori infection was considered by the "reference method" when culture was positive for both histology and rapid urease test (RUT). Results were compared with those obtained using the qPCR. RESULTS: The reference method versus H pylori qPCR positivity showed 95\% confidence interval sensitivity 100\% versus 100\%, specificity 93.2\% (86.9-99.4) versus 100\%, positive predictive value 59.7\% (47.4-71.9) versus 100\%, negative predictive value 100\% versus 100\%, and, finally, test accuracy of 59.6\% (47.3-71.8) versus 100\%. Sixty-two children were found to be H pylori positive, based on the qPCR results. Among those, 31 children had both positive qPCR and culture with concordant antimicrobial susceptibility testing results, whereas 31 children had negative culture and positive qPCR. The qPCR showed a bacterial load {$\geq$}10 copies per milliliter when culture, histology, and RUT were all positive (29/31 children) versus {$<$}10 copies per milliliter when culture, histology, and RUT were all negative (25/31 children). Grades 2 and 3 histological gastritis were associated with a bacterial load {$\geq$}10 copies per milliliter for 28/35 of children versus 27/27 of grade 0 to 1 {$<$}10 copies per milliliter. CONCLUSIONS: H pylori qPCR positivity is a more precise test than the routine culture, histology, RUT alone and allows detecting low bacterial loads.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer, we introduced three different constructs of the tonB gene into the genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We investigated transgene insertion by PCR, produced TonB antibodies for analysis of the production of the recombinant protein in plants, verified the identity of the protein produced by mass spectrometry analysis, and analyzed the number of genetic inserts in the plants by Southern blotting. RESULTS: Three different constructs of the expression cassette (full-length tonB, tonB truncated in the 5' end removing the codons for a transmembrane helix, and the latter construct with codons for the endoplasmic reticulum SEKDEL retention signal added to the 3' end) were used to find the most effective way to express the TonB antigen. Production of TonB protein was detected in plants transformed with each of the constructs, confirmed by both Western blotting and mass spectrometry analysis. No considerable differences in protein expression from the three different constructs were observed. The protein concentration in the plants was at least 0.05\% of the total soluble proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The Helicobacter pylori TonB protein can be produced in Arabidopsis thaliana plants in a form that is recognizable by rabbit anti-TonB antiserum. These TonB-expressing plants are highly suitable for animal studies of oral administration as a route for immunization against Helicobacter infections.},

IL-27 has the capacity to promote early stages of Th1 generation, but recent evidence has suggested a predominant suppressive effect on Th1, Th2, and Th17 differentiation. Although modest suppressive effects of IL-27 on myeloid lineage cells have been observed, there is limited knowledge about the role of IL-27 in the regulation of innate immunity. In this study we report that although in resting murine macrophages IL-27 had minimal if any effects, in resting human monocytes IL-27 had profound proinflammatory functions. IL-27 activated a STAT1-dominant pattern of signaling in human monocytes with the consequent activation of STAT1-dependent inflammatory target genes. IL-27 primed monocytes for augmented responses to TLR stimulation in a STAT1-dependent manner, altered IL-10 signaling, and attenuated IL-10-induced gene expression. Strikingly, IL-27 strongly suppressed TLR-induced IL-10 production in human monocytes. However, the proinflammatory effects of IL-27 on human monocytes were rapidly abrogated by LPS via a p38-mediated mechanism that inhibited IL-27 signaling. Our findings identify a predominantly proinflammatory function for IL-27 in human monocytes and suggest a mechanism by which the activating effects of IL-27 on innate immunity are attenuated as an immune response proceeds and IL-27 transitions to predominantly suppressive effects on acquired immunity.},

The ability to restrain tolerogenic responses while permitting inflammatory responses requires communication between commensal bacteria, intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells. Disruption or improper signaling between any of these factors may lead to uncontrolled inflammation and the development of inflammatory diseases. Toll-like receptors (TLR) recognize conserved molecular motifs of microorganisms and, not surprisingly, are important for maintaining tolerance to commensal microbiota, as well as inducing inflammation against pathogens. Perturbations in individual TLR signaling can lead to a number of different outcomes and illustrate a system of regulation within the intestine in which each TLR plays a largely non-redundant role in mucosal immunity. This review will discuss recent findings on the roles of individual TLRs and intestinal homeostasis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helicobcater pylori colonizes the stomach of more than half of the world's population, and the infection continues to play a key role in the pathogenesis of a number of gastroduodenal diseases. Colonization of the gastric mucosa with Helicobcater pylori results in the development of chronic gastritis in all infected individuals and in a subset of patients chronic gastritis progresses to complications (i.e. ulcer disease, gastric neoplasias, some distinct extragastric disorders). The clinical outcome of the disease is dependent on many variables, including Helicobcater pylori genotype, innate host physiology, genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Helicobcater pylori eradication decreases the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcer and prevents its recurrence. Helicobcater pylori eradication for gastric cancer prevention has been suggested by preclinical research and clinical trials, showing even reversibility of precancerous lesions (atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia) after Helicobcater pylori eradication. AIMS: To review the current literature about H. pylori and its related pathologies. CONCLUSION: At present, several clinical manifestations are recognized to be causally linked to Helicobcater pylori infection, and most of them can be cured by Helicobcater pylori eradication. Besides the relationship of Helicobcater pylori and gastroduodenal diseases, it has been well established that Helicobcater pylori infection is also involved in some extragastrointestinal diseases.},

It is considered to alter transepithelial resistance and mediates visceral hypersensitivity. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of PAR-2 in human esophageal mucosa of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in relation to mucosal alterations. METHODS The study included 123 patients with GERD stratified to erosive reflux disease (n=50), non-erosive reflux disease (n=46), and reflux-negative patients as controls (n=27). Endoscopic and histopathological characterization was performed according to the Los Angeles classification and modified Ismail-Beigi criteria, respectively. PAR-2 expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The gene expression levels of interleukin (IL)-8 were determined by quantitative RT-PCR and correlated to PAR-2 expression in each patient. Performing in vitro studies, esophageal squamous cell lines (KYSE 150, KYSE 450) were incubated, adjusted to different pH (7.0, 6.0, and 5.0), and exposed to bile acids and PAR-2-activation peptide (SLIGKV-NH(2)). RESULTS PAR-2 gene expression was 7- to 10-fold upregulated (P{$<$}0.0001) in the mucosa of patients with GERD and correlated positively with IL-8 expression and with histomorphological alterations (dilated intercellular spaces, papillary elongation, basal cell hyperplasia (BCH); P{$<$}0.01). Immunohistochemistry showed an intense staining of PAR-2 throughout all epithelial layers in patients with GERD compared with controls (P=0.0005). In vitro studies revealed a 1.5- to 20-fold induction of PAR-2 gene expression in esophageal squamous cells by acidified medium (P{$<$}0.01), but not by additional bile acids. The activation of PAR-2 leads to expression and secretion of IL-8. CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence of the functional importance of PAR-2-mediated pathways in the pathogenesis of GERD and GERD-associated mucosal alterations and inflammatory changes.},

In vitro, IL-23 drove the generation of CD4+Foxp3+ROR{$\gamma$}t+IL-17A+ cells from Treg cells. Collectively, our data shows that IL-23 drives Treg plasticity by inducing a population of CD4+Foxp3+ROR{$\gamma$}t+IL-17A+ cells that could play a role in the disease pathogenesis. Through this work, we define an in vitro system and a pre-clinical in vivo mouse model that can be used to further study Treg homeostasis and plasticity in the context of psoriasis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Helicobacter pylori infection increases gastric regulatory T cell (Treg) response, which may contribute to H pylori immune escape. We hypothesize that H pylori directs Treg skewing by way of dendritic cells (DCs) and thus inhibits interleukin-17(+) helper T cells (Th17) immunity. METHODS: Two-photon microscopy was used to locate DCs in gastric lamina propria of mice. The induction of Th17 and Treg responses by bacteria-pulsed murine bone marrow-derived DCs was analyzed by cytokine production and stimulation of T-cell proliferation. The effect of VacA, CagA, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and IL-10 on Th17/Treg balance was assessed. The in vivo significance of Tregs on the H pylori-specific Th17 response and H pylori density was determined by using anti-CD25 neutralizing antibodies to deplete Tregs in mice. RESULTS: We showed that mucosal CD11c(+) DCs are located near the surface of normal gastric epithelium, and their number increased after H pylori infection. Study of the direct interaction of DCs with H pylori showed a Treg-skewed response. The Treg skewing was independent of H pylori VacA and CagA and dependent on TGF-beta and IL-10. In vivo Treg skewing by adoptive transfer of H pylori-pulsed DCs reduces the ratio of gastric IL-17/Foxp3 mRNA expressions. The depletion of CD25(+) Tregs results in early reduction of H pylori density, which is correlated with enhanced peripheral H pylori-specific Th17, but not Th1, response. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study indicates that H pylori alters the DC-polarized Th17/Treg balance toward a Treg-biased response, which suppresses the effective induction of H pylori-specific Th17 immunity.},

  abstract = {Using microarray gene expression analysis, we first observed a profound elevation of human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) message in IL-17-treated primary human airway epithelial cells. Further comparison of this stimulation with a panel of cytokines (IL-1alpha, 1beta, 2-13, and 15-18; IFN-gamma; GM-CSF; and TNF-alpha) demonstrated that IL-17 was the most potent cytokine to induce hBD-2 message ({$>$}75-fold). IL-17-induced stimulation of hBD-2 was time and dose dependent, and this stimulation also occurred at the protein level. Further studies demonstrated that hBD-2 stimulation was attenuated by IL-17R-specific Ab, but not by IL-1R antagonist or the neutralizing anti-IL-6 Ab. This suggests an IL-17R-mediated signaling pathway rather than an IL-17-induced IL-1alphabeta and/or IL-6 autocrine/paracrine loop. hBD-2 stimulation was sensitive to the inhibition of the JAK pathway, and to the inhibitors that affect NF-kappaB translocation and the DNA-binding activity of its p65 NF-kappaB subunit. Transient transfection of airway epithelial cells with an hBD-2 promoter-luciferase reporter gene expression construct demonstrated that IL-17 stimulated promoter-reporter gene activity, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism for hBD-2 induction. These results support an IL-17R-mediated signaling pathway involving JAK and NF-kappaB in the transcriptional stimulation of hBD-2 gene expression in airway epithelium. Because IL-17 has been identified in a number of airway diseases, especially diseases related to microbial infection, these findings provide a new insight into how IL-17 may play an important link between innate and adaptive immunity, thereby combating infection locally within the airway epithelium.},

Although epithelial cells are normally refractory to external stimulation with peptidoglycan, these cells have been shown to respond in a NOD1-dependent manner to Gram-negative pathogens that can either invade or secrete factors into host cells. In the present work, we report that Gram-negative bacteria can deliver peptidoglycan to cytosolic NOD1 in host cells via a novel mechanism involving outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). We purified OMVs from the Gram-negative mucosal pathogens: Helicobacter pylori, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria gonorrhoea and demonstrated that these peptidoglycan containing OMVs upregulated NF-kappaB and NOD1-dependent responses in vitro. These OMVs entered epithelial cells through lipid rafts thereby inducing NOD1-dependent responses in vitro. Moreover, OMVs delivered intragastrically to mice-induced innate and adaptive immune responses via a NOD1-dependent but TLR-independent mechanism. Collectively, our findings identify OMVs as a generalized mechanism whereby Gram-negative bacteria deliver peptidoglycan to cytosolic NOD1. We propose that OMVs released by bacteria in vivo may promote inflammation and pathology in infected hosts.},

The samples were also analyzed for some common gut bacteria by PCR. Positive samples were sequenced for species identification. RESULTS Helicobacter DNA was found in seven out of 100 cases of acute and chronic cholecystitis. Sequence analysis displayed Helicobacter pullorum (H. pullorum) in six cases and Helicobacter pylori in one; H. pullorum was only found in cases with metaplasia. Control samples were negative for Helicobacter spp. and some common gut bacteria. There was a significant difference (P = 0.007) between cholecystitis and control samples for Helicobacter DNA.

Real-time PCR, combining both amplification and detection in one instrument, is a rapid and accurate method for nucleic acid detection and quantification. Although PCR is a very powerful technique, the results achieved are valid only if the appropriate controls have been employed. In addition, proper optimization of PCR conditions is required for the generation of specific, repeatable, reproducible and sensitive data.This book discusses the strategies for preparing effective controls and standards for PCR, when they should be employed and how to interpret the information they provide. It highlights the significance of optimization for efficiency, precision and sensitivity of PCR methodology and provides essential guidance on how to troubleshoot inefficient reactions. Experts in PCR describe design and optimization techniques, discuss the use of appropriate controls, explain the significance of standard curves and explore the principles and strategies required for effective troubleshooting. Authors highlight the importance of sample preparation and quality, primer design, controlling inhibitors, avoiding amplicon and environmental contamination, optimizing reagent quality and concentration, and modifying the thermal cycling protocol for optimal sensitivity and specificity. In addition, specific chapters discuss the history of PCR, the choice of instrumentation, the applications of PCR in metagenomics, high resolution melting analysis, the MIQE guidelines, and PCR at the microliter scale.The strategies, tips and advice contained in this concise volume enable the scientist to optimize and effectively troubleshoot a wide range of techniques including PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR, real-time PCR and quantitative PCR.

We used 454 sequencing technology to perform whole-genome comparisons for five sets of H. pylori strains that had been sequentially cultured from four chronically infected Colombians (isolation intervals=3-16 y) and one human volunteer experimentally infected with H. pylori as part of a vaccine trial. The four sets of genomes from Colombian H. pylori differed by 27-232 isolated SNPs and 16-441 imported clusters of polymorphisms resulting from recombination. Imports (mean length=394 bp) were distributed nonrandomly over the chromosome and frequently occurred in groups, suggesting that H. pylori first takes up long DNA fragments, which subsequently become partially integrated in multiple shorter pieces. Imports were present at significantly increased frequency in members of the hop family of outer membrane gene paralogues, some of which are involved in bacterial adhesion, suggesting diversifying selection. No evidence of recombination and few other differences were identified in the strain pair from an infected volunteer, indicating that the H. pylori genome is stable in the absence of mixed infection. Among these few differences was an OFF/ON switch in the phase-variable adhesin gene hopZ, suggesting strong in vivo selection for this putative adhesin during early colonization.},

The mucus layer was readily distinguishable and its dimensions could be recorded by means of an eyepiece graticule. 2. Mean mucus gel thickness in rat, frog was 73, 76, 55 and 192 micrometer respectively. However, there was variation in the average thickness of the gel layer between individual mucosae from the same species (up to twofold). Mucus thickness between adjacent regions of the same mucosal section also varied markedly (up to tenfold). 3. Topical administration of 16,16-dimethylprostaglandin E2 by oral intubation caused a significant increase in thickness in both rat and frog at doses of 5 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml respectively. Feeding and exposure of the mucosa to N-acetylcysteine (10-20\%, w/v) produced variable effects whereas pepsin (1 mg/ml) caused a marked reduction in thickness of the surface gel layer in both rat and frog. 4.

It has been accepted that H. pylori infection induces a Th17 response. At mucosal sites, dendritic cells (DCs) have the capacity to induce effector T cells. Here, we evaluate the role of DCs in the H. pylori-induced interleukin-17 (IL-17) response. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed on human gastric mucosal biopsy samples and showed that myeloid DCs in H. pylori-infected patients colocalized with IL-23- and that IL-17-producing lymphocytes were present in H. pylori-infected antral biopsy samples. In parallel, human monocyte-derived DCs stimulated in vitro with live H. pylori cells produced significant levels of IL-23 in the absence of IL-12 release. The subsequent incubation of H. pylori-infected DCs with autologous CD4(+) T cells led to gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and IL-17 expression. The inhibition of IL-1 and, to a lesser extent, IL-23 inhibited IL-17 production by T cells. Finally, isogenic H. pylori mutant strains not expressing major virulence factors were less effective in inducing IL-1 and IL-23 release by DCs and IL-17 release by T cells than parental strains. Altogether, we can conclude that DCs are potent inducers of IL-23/IL-17 expression following H. pylori stimulation. IL-1/IL-23 as well as H. pylori virulence factors seem to play an important role in mediating this response.},

  abstract = {Cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) acts directly on gastric epithelial cells. However, the roles of CagA in host adaptive immunity against Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection are not fully understood. In this study, to investigate the roles of CagA in the development of H. pylori-induced chronic gastritis, we used an adoptive-transfer model in which spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice with or without H. pylori infection were transferred into RAG2(-/-) mice, with gastric colonization of either CagA(+) H. pylori or CagA(-) H. pylori. Colonization of CagA(+) H. pylori but not CagA(-) H. pylori in the host gastric mucosa induced severe chronic gastritis in RAG2(-/-) mice transferred with spleen cells from H. pylori-uninfected mice. In addition, when CagA(+) H. pylori-primed spleen cells were transferred into RAG2(-/-) mice, CD4(+) T cell infiltration in the host gastric mucosa were observed only in RAG2(-/-) mice infected with CagA(+) H. pylori but not CagA(-) H. pylori, suggesting that colonization of CagA(+) H. pylori in the host gastric mucosa is essential for the migration of H. pylori-primed CD4(+) T cells. On the other hand, transfer of CagA(-) H. pylori-primed spleen cells into CagA(+) H. pylori-infected RAG2(-/-) mice induced more severe chronic gastritis with less Foxp3(+) regulatory T-cell infiltration as compared to transfer of CagA(+) H. pylori-primed spleen cells. In conclusion, CagA in the stomach plays an important role in the migration of H. pylori-primed CD4(+) T cells in the gastric mucosa, whereas CagA-dependent T-cell priming induces regulatory T-cell differentiation, suggesting dual roles for CagA in the pathophysiology of H. pylori-induced chronic gastritis.},

Although H. pylori is disappearing from the human population, little is known about the influence of H. pylori on the host's microbiota and immunity. Studying the interactions of H. pylori with murine hosts over 6 months, we found stable colonization accompanied by gastric histologic and antibody responses. Analysis of gastric and pulmonary tissues revealed increased expression of multiple immune response genes, conserved across mice and over time in the stomach and more transiently in the lungs. Moreover, H. pylori infection led to significantly different population structures in both the gastric and intestinal microbiota. These studies indicate that H. pylori influences the microbiota and host immune responses not only locally in the stomach, but distantly as well, affecting important target organs.},

As a typical example linking these associations, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection-associated atrophic gastritis has been recognized as precursor lesion of gastric cancer. The identification of transcription factors such as NF-{$\kappa$}B and STAT3, and their gene products such as IL-8, COX-2, iNOS, cytokines, chemokines and their receptors, etc have laid the molecular foundation for our understanding of the decisive role of inflammation in carcinogenesis. In addition to the role as the initiator of cancer, inflammation contributes to survival and proliferation of malignant cells, tumor angiogenesis, and even metastasis. In this review, the fundamental mechanisms of H. pylori-induced carcinogenesis as well as the possibility of cancer prevention through suppressing H. pylori-induced inflammation are introduced. We infer that targeting inflammatory pathways have a potential role to detour the unpleasant journey to H. pylori-associated gastric carcinogenesis.},

CD4(+)CD45RB(high) T cells from mice deficient for the {$\alpha$}-chain of IL-27 receptor failed to induce colitis in Rag(-/-) recipients, because of an inability of activated donor cells to survive. Interestingly, IL-27 was indispensable for the prevention of colitis by regulatory T cells, also because of a defect in long-term cell survival. IL-27 affected the survival of activated T lymphocytes, rather than promoting cell proliferation, by inhibiting Fas-mediated activation-induced T cell death, acting through the STAT3 signaling pathway. The addition of IL-27 during activation resulted in an increased cell number, which was correlated with decreased activation of both caspases 3 and 8. This prosurvival effect was attributed to downregulation of FasL and to the induction of the antiapoptotic protein cFLIP. Although activation induced cell death is an important mechanism for the maintenance of immunological homeostasis, protection of lymphocytes from excessive cell death is essential for effective immunity. Our data indicate that IL-27 has a crucial role in the inhibition of activation-induced cell death, thereby permitting Ag-driven T cell expansion.},

Systemic administration of flagellin, a bacterial protein that stimulates Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), induces epithelial expression of RegIII{$\gamma$} and protects mice from intestinal colonization with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Flagellin-induced RegIII{$\gamma$} expression is IL-22 dependent, but how TLR signaling leads to IL-22 expression is incompletely defined. By using conditional depletion of lamina propria dendritic cell (LPDC) subsets, we demonstrated that CD103(+)CD11b(+) LPDCs, but not monocyte-derived CD103(-)CD11b(+) LPDCs, expressed high amounts of IL-23 after bacterial flagellin administration and drove IL-22-dependent RegIII{$\gamma$} production. Maximal expression of IL-23 subunits IL-23p19 and IL-12p40 occurred within 60 min of exposure to flagellin. IL-23 subsequently induced a burst of IL-22 followed by sustained RegIII{$\gamma$} expression. Thus, CD103(+)CD11b(+) LPDCs, in addition to promoting long-term tolerance to ingested antigens, also rapidly produce IL-23 in response to detection of flagellin in the lamina propria.},

When serum concentrations of gastrin are elevated, proliferation of both the progenitor cells in the glandular neck zone and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells in the bottom of the glands is stimulated. Because ECL cells have gastrin receptors, their proliferation is directly stimulated by gastrin. However, because the proliferation of progenitor cells cannot be directly stimulated (so far there has been no gastrin receptor demonstrated on these proliferating cells), some indirect mechanisms must be involved. Enterochromaffin-like and parietal cells are only two types of cells that have demonstrated a strong gene expression of the gastrin receptor. Furthermore, they secrete several growth factors, such as Reg protein, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and amphiregulin (AR). Reg protein production by ECL cells, as well as HB-EGF and AR production by parietal cells, is stimulated by gastrin and these growth factors are potent trophic agents of progenitor cells in the neck zone of the gastric fundic mucosa. Accordingly, gastrin may stimulate the proliferation of gastric mucosal cells indirectly via these growth factors in addition to its direct trophic effect on ECL cells.},

Molecular techniques as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may detect bacterial DNA in histologically negative gastritis. AIM: To evaluate of Helicobacter PCR in gastric biopsies for the daily diagnostics of Helicobacter-negative gastritis. METHODS: Over a 5-year period, routine biopsies with chronic gastritis reminiscent of Helicobacter infection, but negative by histology, were tested by using a H. pylori specific PCR. Subsequently, PCR-negative samples were re-evaluated using PCR for other Helicobacter species. RESULTS: Of the 9184 gastric biopsies, 339 (3.7\%) with histological-negative gastritis and adequate material were forwarded to PCR analysis for H. pylori and 146 (43.1\%) revealed a positive result. In 193 H. pylori DNA-negative biopsies, re-analysis using PCR primers for other Helicobacter species, revealed further 23 (11.9\%) positive biopsies, including 4 (2.1\%) biopsies with H. heilmannii sensu lato. PCR-positive biopsies showed a higher overall inflammatory score, more lymphoid follicles/aggregates and neutrophils (P {$<$} 0.05). No Helicobacter DNA was found in control biopsies of 48 patients with neither primer set (P {$<$} 0.0001). In 274 patients with an endoscopic description, detection of H. pylori DNA was associated with ulcers and erosions (P {$<$} 0.01). Over all, in 339 histologically-negative gastric biopsies, Helicobacter DNA was detected in 169 (49.9\%) samples with at least one primer set. CONCLUSION: Molecular testing offers a sensitive and specific diagnosis to a selected group of patients, in whom adequate searches for bacteria by conventional histology have resulted in the unsatisfactory diagnosis of H. pylori-negative gastritis.},

A further focus was put on the interaction between H.~pylori and dendritic cells, with some emphasis on the inflammasome and the resulting T-cell responses. Moreover, the function of microRNAs in macrophages and gastric MALT lymphoma development has been studied in more detail.

We obtained a hypergastrinemic mouse line whose average serum gastrin level is 671 +/- 252 pg/ml (normal level {$<$}150 pg/ml). Gastrin-positive cells were found in the fundic mucosa. The gastric mucosa exhibited hypertrophic growth, which was characterized by an elongated pit with an active proliferative zone, but the glandular region containing parietal cells was normal or reduced in size. The GSM cells contained fewer mucous granules than those of control littermates and lost reactivity to the GSM cell-specific cholera toxin beta-subunit lectin. GSM cells along the foveolar region and many mucous neck cells became Alcian blue positive, suggesting the appearance of sialomucin in these cells.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is one of the most common bacterial pathogens in humans but the route of transmission remains unclear. We investigated transmission by DNA fingerprinting analysis of cultured H. pylori from pediatric patients and their family members. METHODS: Forty-two index patients with a mean age of 11.7 years (range, 4-19) were diagnosed as having H. pylori gastritis with or without duodenal/gastric ulcer disease. A total of 66 family members for whom the results of the H. pylori stool antigen test and/or serum H. pylori IgG test were positive underwent endoscopic examination and biopsy or aspiration of gastric juice for H. pylori culture. The extraction of H. pylori genomic DNA and PCR-based RAPD analysis were performed. RESULTS: Thirty-two (76\%) of the 42 patients showed DNA fingerprint patterns identical to those of at least one of the respective family members. The patterns of 29 (69\%) of the analyses of the H. pylori infected patients were identical to those of their mothers. The patterns for 7 patients were identical to those of their fathers, and those for 6 of the latter patients were also identical to those of their mothers. The rate of fingerprint patterns identical to those of the index patients was significantly higher in those of mothers compared with those of fathers (P {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Mother-to-child transmission is the predominant route of H. pylori infection in Japan.},

Low grade, mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-lymphoma is an unique among gastric malignancies where causal involvement of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has been proposed based on complete regression of the tumor following the eradication therapy. In this report ten primary, low-grade MALT-lymphomas have been examined before and 6 months after one week of successful eradication therapy (clarithromycin + amoxicillin + omeprazole). Gastric biopsy samples from tumor and intact antrum and corpus mucosa were obtained during endoscopy before and after eradication for assessment of expression of gastrin and gastrin receptor (CCKB-R) as well as cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 using RT-PCR. The gastric lumen and serum gastrin and mucosal and tumor tissue PGE2 biosynthesis were determined by RIA before and after H. pylori eradication. Eradication of H. pylori resulted in complete endoscopic and histological remission of MALT-lymphoma in 9 out of 10 patients as assessed 6 months after this eradication. Before eradication, the mRNA expression for gastrin and CCKB-R as well as mRNA expression for COX-1 and COX-2 were observed in tumor tissue and infected mucosa, while corpus mucosa expressed only CCKB-R and antrum mucosa only gastrin. Six months upon the eradication when MALT-lymphoma completely regressed both endoscopically and histologically in 9 of 10 tested subjects, the expression of gastrin and COX-2 disappeared from the former area of MALT-lymphoma tumor. Gastrin mRNA remained detectable only in antrum mucosa, CCKB-R mRNA in corpus mucosa and COX-1 mRNA both in antrum and corpus mucosa. Gastric luminal and serum gastrin levels and gastric mucosa and tumor PGE2, which were greatly elevated before eradication, became normalized after this procedure. This study demonstrates that low-grade MALT-lymphoma is linked to H. pylori infection which may promote the expression and excessive release of gastrin and COX-2 expression that could be involved in the pathogenesis of MALT-lymphoma.},

  abstract = {CD4+ T cells, upon activation and expansion, develop into different T helper cell subsets with different cytokine profiles and distinct effector functions. Until recently, T cells were divided into Th1 or Th2 cells, depending on the cytokines they produce. A third subset of IL-17-producing effector T helper cells, called Th17 cells, has now been discovered and characterized. Here, we summarize the current information on the differentiation and effector functions of the Th17 lineage. Th17 cells produce IL-17, IL-17F, and IL-22, thereby inducing a massive tissue reaction owing to the broad distribution of the IL-17 and IL-22 receptors. Th17 cells also secrete IL-21 to communicate with the cells of the immune system. The differentiation factors (TGF-beta plus IL-6 or IL-21), the growth and stabilization factor (IL-23), and the transcription factors (STAT3, RORgammat, and RORalpha) involved in the development of Th17 cells have just been identified. The participation of TGF-beta in the differentiation of Th17 cells places the Th17 lineage in close relationship with CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), as TGF-beta also induces differentiation of naive T cells into Foxp3+ Tregs in the peripheral immune compartment. The investigation of the differentiation, effector function, and regulation of Th17 cells has opened up a new framework for understanding T cell differentiation. Furthermore, we now appreciate the importance of Th17 cells in clearing pathogens during host defense reactions and in inducing tissue inflammation in autoimmune disease.},

Two flagellin species of pI 5.2 and with apparent subunit molecular weights (Mrs) of 57,000 and 56,000 were obtained. N-terminal amino acid analysis showed that the two H. pylori flagellin species were related to each other and shared sequence similarity with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of Campylobacter coli, Bacillus, Salmonella, and Caulobacter flagellins. Analysis of the amino acid composition of the predominant 56,000-Mr flagellin species isolated from two strains showed that it was comparable to the flagellins of other species. The minor 57,000-Mr flagellin species contained a higher content of proline. Immunoelectron microscopic studies with polyclonal monospecific H. pylori antiflagellin antiserum and monoclonal antibody (MAb) 72c showed that the two different-Mr flagellin species were located in different regions of the assembled flagellar filament. The minor 57,000-Mr species was located proximal to the hook, and the major 56,000-Mr flagellin composed the remainder of the filament. Western immunoblot analysis with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against H. pylori or Campylobacter jejuni flagellins and MAb 72c showed that the 56,000-Mr flagellin carried sequences antigenetically cross-reactive with the 57,000-Mr H. pylori flagellin and the flagellins of Campylobacter species. This antigenic cross-reactivity did not extend to the flagellins of other gram-negative bacteria. The 56,000-Mr flagellin also carried H. pylori-specific sequences recognized by two additional MAbs. The epitopes for these MAbs were not surface exposed on the assembled inner flagellar filament of H. pylori but were readily detected by immunodot blot assay of sodium dodecyl sulfate-lysed cells of H. pylori, suggesting that this serological test could be a useful addition to those currently employed in the rapid identification of this important pathogen.},

To explore immunization as a strategy for preventing and treating H. pylori-associated disease, we assessed the safety and immunogenicity in healthy adults of a formalin-inactivated, oral H. pylori whole-cell (HWC) vaccine, administered with or without mutant Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin (LT(R192G)) as a mucosal adjuvant. In a dose-response study, 23 subjects with or without H. pylori infection were vaccinated with either 2.5 x 10(6) HWC, 2.5 x 10(8) HWC, or 2.5 x 10(10) HWC, plus 25 microg of LT(R192G). Thereafter, a randomized study was conducted in which 18 H. pylori-infected subjects were assigned, in a double-blind fashion, to receive either 2.5 x 10(10) HWC plus placebo-adjuvant, placebo-vaccine plus 25 microg of LT(R192G), placebo-vaccine plus placebo-adjuvant, or 2.5 x 10(10) HWC plus 25 microg of LT(R192G). Diarrhea (six subjects), low-grade fever (five subjects), and vomiting (two subjects) were observed, usually after the first dose. Significant rises in geometric mean mucosal (fecal and salivary) anti-HWC immunoglobulin A antibodies occurred among H. pylori-infected and uninfected subjects following inoculation with 2.5 x 10(10) HWC plus 25 microg of LT(R192G). Moreover, among H. pylori-negative volunteers, this regimen induced significant lymphoproliferative responses in 5 of 10 subjects and gamma interferon production responses to H. pylori sonicate in 7 of 10 subjects. There was no evidence that vaccination eradicated H. pylori in infected volunteers. These results suggest that it is possible to stimulate mucosal and systemic immune responses in humans to H. pylori antigens by using an HWC vaccine.},

Most frequently, these are housekeeping genes and they must meet several criteria so that they can lay claim to the name. Lots of papers report that in different conditions, for different organisms and even tissues the basic assumption-the constant level of the expression is not maintained for many genes that seem to be perfect candidates. Moreover, their transcription can not be affected by experimental factors. Sounds simple and clear but a great number of designed protocols and lack of consistency among them brings confusion on how to perform experiment properly. Since during selection of the most stable normalizing gene we can not use any reference gene, different ways and algorithms for their selection were developed. Such methods, including examples of best normalizing genes in some specific cases and possible mistakes are presented based on available sources. Numerous examples of reference genes applications, which are usually in too few numbers in relevant articles not allowing to make a solid fundament for a reader, will be shown along with instructive compilations to make an evidence for presented statements and an arrangement of future qPCR experiments. To include all the pitfalls and problems associated with the normalization methods there is no way not to begin from sample preparation and its storage going through candidate gene selection, primer design and statistical analysis. This is important because numerous short reviews available cover the topic only in lesser extent at the same time giving the reader false conviction of complete topic recognition.},

We have determined the comprehensive methylomes of two H. pylori strains at single base resolution, using Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT\textregistered ) sequencing. For strains 26695 and J99-R3, 17 and 22 methylated sequence motifs were identified, respectively. For most motifs, almost all sites occurring in the genome were detected as methylated. Twelve novel methylation patterns corresponding to nine recognition sequences were detected (26695, 3; J99-R3, 6). Functional inactivation, correction of frameshifts as well as cloning and expression of candidate methyltransferases (MTases) permitted not only the functional characterization of multiple, yet undescribed, MTases, but also revealed novel features of both Type I and Type II R-M systems, including frameshift-mediated changes of sequence specificity and the interaction of one MTase with two alternative specificity subunits resulting in different methylation patterns. The methylomes of these well-characterized H. pylori strains will provide a valuable resource for future studies investigating the role of H. pylori R-M systems in limiting transformation as well as in gene regulation and host interaction.},

The tools for studying the biology of IL-12 in man and laboratory rodents have greatly advanced our appreciation of the central role of this molecule in cell-mediated immunity and inflammation. In particular, IL-12 is thought to be the prime-regulator of TH1 development. Targeting what was thought to be IL-12 function in vivo, resulted in drastic amelioration of inflammation and autoimmunity firmly linking TH1 polarisation to autoimmune development. Upon discovery of IL-23 and the fact that the large subunit of IL-23 is shared by IL-12, the research community only begins to grasp that the features attributed to IL-12 and TH1 development in inflammation are, in fact, dependent on IL-23 and not on IL-12. Hence, the perception of IL-12 biology is, to a large extent, based on a mistaken identity.

In order to assess the Th1 responses in human neonates with high susceptibility to infectious diseases, expression of EBI3-, p28- and WSX-1-mRNA in response to Toll-like receptor ligands was compared in neonate and adult monocyte-derived (m)DC. Only the combined addition of ligands induced expression of IL-27p28 mRNA. Surprisingly, neonatal mDC produced significantly more IL-27p28 mRNA than that obtained from adults. Furthermore, there was enhanced expression of EBI3 mRNA in cord blood as compared with adult blood. In addition, the secretion of WSX-1 mRNA in neonatal mDC and T cells was also significantly increased. Taken together, these findings indicate that the restricted Th1 responses in human newborns owing to deficient IL-12 production may be compensated for, in part, by enhanced IL-27 secretion.},

  abstract = {Morphological variability is one of the phenotypic features related to adaptation of microorganisms to stressful environmental conditions and increased tolerance to antimicrobial substances. Helicobacter pylori, a gastric mucosal pathogen, is characterized by a high heterogeneity and an ability to transform from a spiral to a coccoid form. The presence of the coccoid form is associated with the capacity to avoid immune system detection and to promote therapeutic failures. For this reason, it seems that the investigation for new, alternative methods combating H. pylori should include research of coccoid forms of this pathogen. The current review aimed at collecting information about the activity of antibacterial substances against H. pylori in the context of the morphological variability of this bacterium. The collected data was discussed in terms of the type of substances used, applied research techniques, and interpretation of results. The review was extended by a polemic on the limitations in determining the viability of coccoid H. pylori forms. Finally, recommendations which can help in future research aiming to find new compounds with a potential to eradicate H. pylori have been formulated.},

We have recently found that IL-17(+) cells are accumulated in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), where they promote disease progression by fostering angiogenesis. In this study, we showed that Tc17 cells constitute a remarkable portion of IL-17-producing cells in human HCC. Although most circulating Tc17 cells were negative for IFN-gamma, {$>$}80\% of Tc17 cells in HCC tissues were positive for IFN-gamma, and they were enriched predominantly in invading tumor edge. Most CD68(+) cells located in invading tumor edge exhibited an activated phenotype and, accordingly, the activated monocytes isolated from HCC tissues were significantly superior to those isolated from nontumor tissues in inducing expansion of Tc17 cells in vitro with phenotypic features similar to those isolated from tumors. Compared with IL-17(-)IFN-gamma(+)CD8(+) cells, these IFN-gamma(+)Tc17 cells have significantly higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-22, and TNF-alpha), but reduced expression of granzyme B and perforin. Moreover, we found that tumor-activated monocytes secreted a set of key cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-23) to trigger the proliferation of Tc17 cells. These data reveal an intriguing mechanism in which human Tc17 cells are generated by a fine-tuned collaborative action between different types of immune cells in distinct tumor microenvironments.},

  abstract = {Asthma is a serious health and socioeconomic issue all over the world, affecting more than 300 million individuals. The disease is considered as an inflammatory disease in the airway, leading to airway hyperresponsiveness, obstruction, mucus hyper-production and airway wall remodeling. The presence of airway inflammation in asthmatic patients has been found in the nineteenth century. As the information in patients with asthma increase, paradigm change in immunology and molecular biology have resulted in an extensive evaluation of inflammatory cells and mediators involved in the pathophysiology of asthma. Moreover, it is recognized that airway remodeling into detail, characterized by thickening of the airway wall, can be profound consequences on the mechanics of airway narrowing and contribute to the chronic progression of the disease. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition plays an important role in airway remodeling. These epithelial and mesenchymal cells cause persistence of the inflammatory infiltration and induce histological changes in the airway wall, increasing thickness of the basement membrane, collagen deposition and smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Resulting of airway inflammation, airway remodeling leads to the airway wall thickening and induces increased airway smooth muscle mass, which generate asthmatic symptoms. Asthma is classically recognized as the typical Th2 disease, with increased IgE levels and eosinophilic inflammation in the airway. Emerging Th2 cytokines modulates the airway inflammation, which induces airway remodeling. Biological agents, which have specific molecular targets for these Th2 cytokines, are available and clinical trials for asthma are ongoing. However, the relatively simple paradigm has been doubted because of the realization that strategies designed to suppress Th2 function are not effective enough for all patients in the clinical trials. In the future, it is required to understand more details for phenotypes of asthma.},

H. pylori gastritis may progress to atrophic gastritis and lead to the development of intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and eventually gastric cancer in a minority of subjects. The available data on the kinetics of H. pylori gastritis are limited, but nevertheless very consistent. They suggest that the progression to gland loss or atrophic gastritis among H. pylori-positive subjects occurs at a rate of 1-2\% per year. As H. pylori gastritis usually persists for life, a considerable proportion of H. pylori-positive subjects thus eventually show signs of gastric gland loss. The majority of these subjects progress to intestinal metaplasia. Despite these consistent findings in different areas of the world, the incidence of gastric cancer is only moderately related to the prevalence of H. pylori. An example is the so-called African enigma, referring to a low incidence of gastric cancer in certain countries of Africa, despite a high prevalence of H. pylori in all age groups. This is not due to differences in progression to atrophic gastritis; other yet unidentified factors therefore must play a role.},

We observed that CagI is a predominantly membrane attached periplasmic protein partially exposed to the bacterial surface especially on the pili. The association of the protein with membrane appeared to be loose as it could be easily recovered in soluble fraction. We documented that the stability of the protein is dependent on several key components of the secretion system and it has multiple interacting partners including a non-cag-PAI protein HP1489. Translocation of CagA across the bacterial membranes to cell surface is CagI-independent process. The observations made herein are expected to assist in providing an insight into the substrate translocation by the Cag-T4SS system and Helicobacter pylori pathogenesis.},

Unless treated, colonization usually persists lifelong. H. pylori infection represents a key factor in the etiology of various gastrointestinal diseases, ranging from chronic active gastritis without clinical symptoms to peptic ulceration, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Disease outcome is the result of the complex interplay between the host and the bacterium. Host immune gene polymorphisms and gastric acid secretion largely determine the bacterium's ability to colonize a specific gastric niche. Bacterial virulence factors such as the cytotoxin-associated gene pathogenicity island-encoded protein CagA and the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA aid in this colonization of the gastric mucosa and subsequently seem to modulate the host's immune system. This review focuses on the microbiological, clinical, immunological, and biochemical aspects of the pathogenesis of H. pylori.},

We propose that integrins are exploited by the gastric pathogen and type-1 carcinogen Helicobacter pylori for injection of the bacterial oncoprotein cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) into gastric epithelial cells. Virulent H. pylori express a type-IV secretion pilus that injects CagA into the host cell; CagA then becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src family kinases. However, the identity of the host cell receptor involved in this process has remained unknown. Here we show that the H. pylori CagL protein is a specialized adhesin that is targeted to the pilus surface, where it binds to and activates integrin alpha5beta1 receptor on gastric epithelial cells through an arginine-glycine-aspartate motif. This interaction triggers CagA delivery into target cells as well as activation of focal adhesion kinase and Src. Our findings provide insights into the role of integrins in H.-pylori-induced pathogenesis. CagL may be exploited as a new molecular tool for our further understanding of integrin signalling.},

  abstract = {MUC1 (or Muc1 in nonhuman species) is a membrane-tethered mucin expressed on the apical surface of mucosal epithelia (including those of the airways) that suppresses Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. We sought to determine whether the anti-inflammatory effect of MUC1 is operative during infection with nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), and if so, which TLR pathway was affected. Our results showed that: (1) a lysate of NTHi increased the early release of IL-8 and later production of MUC1 protein by A549 cells in dose-dependent and time-dependent manners, compared with vehicle control; (2) both effects were attenuated after transfection of the cells with a TLR2-targeting small interfering (si) RNA, compared with a control siRNA; (3) the NTHi-induced release of IL-8 was suppressed by an overexpression of MUC1, and was enhanced by the knockdown of MUC1; (4) the TNF-{$\alpha$} released after treatment with NTHi was sufficient to up-regulate MUC1, which was completely inhibited by pretreatment with a soluble TNF-{$\alpha$} receptor; and (5) primary murine tracheal surface epithelial (MTSE) cells from Muc1 knockout mice exhibited an increased in vitro production of NTHi-stimulated keratinocyte chemoattractant compared with MTSE cells from Muc1-expressing animals. These results suggest a hypothetical feedback loop model whereby NTHi activates TLRs (mainly TLR2) in airway epithelial cells, leading to the increased production of TNF-{$\alpha$} and IL-8, which subsequently up-regulate the expression of MUC1, resulting in suppressed TLR signaling and decreased production of IL-8. This report is the first, to the best of our knowledge, demonstrating that the inflammatory response in airway epithelial cells during infection with NTHi is controlled by MUC1 mucin, mainly through the suppression of TLR2 signaling.},

Bacteria were found in 40 (38.5\%), 38 (36.5\%), 36 (34.6\%), and 35 (33.7\%) of the patients by ureC PCR, culture, the rapid-urease test, and Giemsa stain, respectively. Sixty-three patients had negative cultures, negative histological examinations, and negative rapid-urease test results, and 61 of these patients were also negative by ureC PCR. ureC PCR detected H. pylori in two culture-negative patients. In parallel, a PCR-based assay to detect the H. pylori cytotoxin-associated antigen (cagA) gene, a putative virulence gene, was also developed. To assess the likelihood of detection of H. pylori genes directly from gastric biopsy samples and from the corresponding H. pylori isolates, specimens from 31 patients were subjected to PCR with ureC- and cagA-targeting primers. All 31 biopsy specimens and the corresponding H. pylori isolates were positive in the ureC PCR. H. pylori strains that were cagA positive also gave positive cagA PCR fragments with biopsy specimens from the same patients. All ureC PCR-positive patients were examined; biopsy specimens from 10 of 11 (91.7\%) duodenal ulcer patients harbored H. pylori cagA-positive strains, whereas 19 of26 (73\%) of those from patients with chronic gastritis only were found to be cagA positive. These findings indicate first that ureC PCR is at least as sensitive as culture for diagnosing H. pylori infection and second that the presence of the H. pylori cagA gene can also be detected directly in biopsy specimens by PCR amplification.},

Under normal conditions, mucosal integrity is maintained by defense mechanisms, which include preepithelial factors (mucus-bicarbonate-phospholipid "barrier"), an epithelial "barrier" (surface epithelial cells connected by tight junctions and generating bicarbonate, mucus, phospholipids, trefoil peptides, prostaglandins (PGs), and heat shock proteins), continuous cell renewal accomplished by proliferation of progenitor cells (regulated by growth factors, PGE(2) and survivin), continuous blood flow through mucosal microvessels, an endothelial "barrier," sensory innervation, and generation of PGs and nitric oxide. Mucosal injury may occur when noxious factors "overwhelm" an intact mucosal defense or when the mucosal defense is impaired. We review basic components of gastric mucosal defense and discuss conditions in which mucosal injury is directly related to impairment in mucosal defense, focusing on disorders with important clinical sequelae: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated injury, which is primarily related to inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-mediated PG synthesis, and stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD), which occurs with local ischemia. The annual incidence of NSAID-associated upper gastrointestinal (GI) complications such as bleeding is approximately 1\%-1.5\%; and reductions in these complications have been demonstrated with misoprostol, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (only documented in high-risk patients), and COX-2 selective inhibitors. Clinically significant bleeding from SRMD is relatively uncommon with modern intensive care. Pharmacologic therapy with antisecretory drugs may be used in high-risk patients (eg, mechanical ventilation {$>$}or=48 hours), although the absolute risk reduction is small, and a decrease in mortality is not documented.},

  abstract = {Chronic inflammation has long been associated with increased incidence of malignancy and similarities in the regulatory mechanisms have been suggested for more than a century. Infiltration of innate immune cells, elevated activities of matrix metalloproteases and increased angiogenesis and vasculature density are a few examples of the similarities between chronic and tumour-associated inflammation. Conversely, the elimination of early malignant lesions by immune surveillance, which relies on the cytotoxic activity of tumour-infiltrating T cells or intra-epithelial lymphocytes, is thought to be rate-limiting for the risk to develop cancer. Here we show a molecular connection between the rise in tumour-associated inflammation and a lack of tumour immune surveillance. Expression of the heterodimeric cytokine interleukin (IL)-23, but not of its close relative IL-12, is increased in human tumours. Expression of these cytokines antagonistically regulates local inflammatory responses in the tumour microenvironment and infiltration of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. Whereas IL-12 promotes infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, IL-23 promotes inflammatory responses such as upregulation of the matrix metalloprotease MMP9, and increases angiogenesis but reduces CD8 T-cell infiltration. Genetic deletion or antibody-mediated elimination of IL-23 leads to increased infiltration of cytotoxic T cells into the transformed tissue, rendering a protective effect against chemically induced carcinogenesis. Finally, transplanted tumours are growth-restricted in hosts depleted for IL-23 or in IL-23-receptor-deficient mice. Although many strategies for immune therapy of cancer attempt to stimulate an immune response against solid tumours, infiltration of effector cells into the tumour tissue often appears to be a critical hurdle. We show that IL-23 is an important molecular link between tumour-promoting pro-inflammatory processes and the failure of the adaptive immune surveillance to infiltrate tumours.},

IL-23 is a heterodimer, comprising IL-12 p40 and the recently cloned IL-23-specific p19 subunit. IL-23 uses many of the same signal-transduction components as IL-12, including IL-12Rbeta1, Janus kinase 2, Tyk2, signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)1, Stat3, Stat4, and Stat5. This may explain the similar actions of IL-12 and IL-23 in promoting cellular immunity by inducing interferon-gamma production and proliferative responses in target cells. Additionally, both cytokines promote the T helper cell type 1 costimulatory function of antigen-presenting cells. IL-23 does differ from IL-12 in the T cell subsets that it targets. Whereas IL-12 acts on na\"ive CD4+ T cells, IL-23 preferentially acts on memory CD4+ T cells.

Ten unique cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses were identified. All found that screening for H. pylori to prevent gastric cancer in the general population costs less than \$50,000 per LYG. This finding was robust for differences in H. pylori prevalence, gender and ethnicity. Based on limited evidence, re-treatment (for treatment failure), repeated screening, limiting screening and treatment to those with the CagA phenotype, or universal treatment, does not appear to be cost-effective. However, most included studies failed to consider both the broader benefits as well as the adverse effects of widespread use of antibiotics for H. pylori.},

  abstract = {IL-27 is a novel heterodimeric cytokine of the IL-12 family that plays an important role in the regulation of T cell responses. Its role on human B cells has not been previously studied. In this study, we show that both chains of the IL-27 receptor complex, IL-27R and gp130, are constitutively expressed at the surface of naive and memory human tonsillar B cells, and are induced on germinal center B cells following CD40 stimulation. In naive B cells, IL-27 induced strong STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation, whereas it induced moderate STAT1 and low STAT3 activation in memory B cells. IL-27 induced T-bet expression in naive and memory B cells stimulated by CD40 or surface Ig engagement, but induced significant IL-12Rbeta2 surface expression in anti-Ig-stimulated naive B cells only. In anti-Ig-stimulated naive or memory B cells, IL-27 also induced CD54, CD86, and CD95 surface expression. In addition, IL-27 increased proliferation of anti-Ig-activated naive B cells and of anti-CD40-activated naive and germinal center B cells, but not of CD40-activated memory B cells. These data indicate that the B cell response to IL-27 is modulated during B cell differentiation and varies depending on the mode of B cell activation.},

  abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-27 is a newly described member of the IL-12 family. It is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of two subunits, p28 and Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3). In vitro studies have shown that IL-27 is mainly produced by activated monocytes and dendritic cells. It induces the proliferation of na\"ive CD4-positive T cells and synergizes with IL-12 for interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production. Knock-out mice for the IL-27 receptor (WSX-1/TCCR) have impaired Th1 responses and form abnormal granulomas when injected with bacillus Calmette-Gu\'erin. However, the expression profile of IL-27 in vivo is currently unknown. To investigate the potential role of IL-27 in the development of a Th1 response in humans in vivo, this study has analysed the in situ expression of IL-27 subunits in three types of granulomatous disease (tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and Crohn's disease), each characterized by a Th1 response. Tissue sections from patients with tuberculosis (n = 9), sarcoidosis (n = 8), or Crohn's disease (n = 7) were analysed by immunohistochemistry with anti-EBI3 and anti-p28 antibodies, in parallel with control tissues (control reactive lymph nodes, n = 14, and control intestinal tissues, n = 11). In granulomatous tissues, EBI3 and p28 co-expression was detected in epithelioid and multinucleate giant cells in granulomas. In addition, sinus or tissue macrophages, endothelial cells, and plasma cells were found to co-express EBI3 and p28. These data support a possible role for IL-27 in human Th1 responses.},

Currently, there is no alternative to RT(-) controls to evaluate the impact of the gDNA background on RT\textendash PCR data. We propose a novel method (ValidPrime) that is more accurate than traditional RT(-) controls to test qPCR assays with respect to their sensitivity toward gDNA. ValidPrime measures the gDNA contribution using an optimized gDNA-specific ValidPrime assay (VPA) and gDNA reference sample(s). The VPA, targeting a non-transcribed locus, is used to measure the gDNA contents in RT(+) samples and the gDNA reference is used to normalize for GOI-specific differences in gDNA sensitivity. We demonstrate that the RNA-derived component of the signal can be accurately estimated and deduced from the total signal. ValidPrime corrects with high precision for both exogenous (spiked) and endogenous gDNA, contributing {$\sim$}60\% of the total signal, whereas substantially reducing the number of required qPCR control reactions. In conclusion, ValidPrime offers a cost-efficient alternative to RT(-) controls and accurately corrects for signals derived from gDNA in RT\textendash qPCR.},

Because of its importance for Treg cells, we examined the role of IL-2 in Th17 generation and demonstrate that a previously unrecognized aspect of IL-2 function is to constrain IL-17 production. Genetic deletion or antibody blockade of IL-2 promoted differentiation of the Th17 cell subset. Whereas STAT3 appeared to be a key positive regulator of RORgammat and IL-17 expression, absence of IL-2 or disruption of its signaling by deletion of the transcription factor STAT5 resulted in enhanced Th17 cell development. We conclude that in addition to the promotion of activation-induced cell death of lymphocytes and the generation of Treg cells, inhibition of Th17 polarization appears to be an important function of IL-2.},

We performed a cross-sectional study of patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy with submission of gastric and duodenal biopsies to Miraca Life Sciences, Inc. (Irving, Texas), a US commercial pathology laboratory, during a 4.5-year period (January 2008-June 2012). We compared the prevalence of H. pylori in CD patients with that in persons without CD. We performed multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusting odds ratios for patient age, gender, and racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors. Among 136,179 patients, a total of 2,689 (2.0\%) had CD. H. pylori prevalence was significantly lower in patients with CD (4.4\%) than in those without CD (8.8\%; P {$<$} 0.0001). After adjustment for the above covariates, this inverse relationship remained strong (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.48, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.40, 0.58). The relationships were similar in men (unadjusted OR = 0.51, 95\% CI: 0.38, 0.69) and women (unadjusted OR = 0.46, 95\% CI: 0.36, 0.58) and in all age groups. We conclude that H. pylori presence and CD are inversely associated, a relationship that persists after adjustment for socioeconomic factors.

Whereas the Th1-Th2 paradigm revolutionized our understanding of adaptive immunity by introducing the concept of alternative developmental pathways for na\"ive CD4 T cells induced by distinct cytokine cues from microbe-activated innate immune cells, delineation of Th17 cell differentiation has extended this concept and has led to a greater appreciation of the developmental plasticity of CD4 T cells. In contrast to Th1 and Th2 cells, which have been thought to represent terminal products of their respective developmental programs, recent studies suggest that Th17 cells are less rigid. In addition to early developmental links to induced regulatory T cells (Tregs) reflected in the shared requirement for TGF-beta, it is now apparent that there is substantial plasticity late in the Th17 program, which allows committed Th17 cells to transition from effectors that produce predominantly IL-17A and IL-17F, to effectors that produce predominantly IFNgamma. Tregs appear to have similar plasticity. This promises new insights into strategies for balancing antimicrobial defense with restraints on immune-mediated tissue injury, and raises new questions regarding the stability of epigenetic modifications that accompany induction of cytokine gene expression during T cell lineage development.},

However, some investigators urge caution based on the hypothesis that eradication of H. pylori may result in an increase in the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and childhood asthma. The ethnic Malays of northeastern Peninsular Malaysia have long had a low prevalence of H. pylori infection and, as expected, the incidence of gastric cancer and its precursor lesions is exceptionally low. The availability of a population with a low H. pylori prevalence and generally poor sanitation allows separation of H. pylori from the hygiene hypothesis and direct testing of whether absence of H. pylori is associated with untoward consequence. Contrary to predictions, in Malays, erosive esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, distal esophageal cancers, and childhood asthma are all of low incidence. This suggests that H. pylori is not protective rather the presence of H. pylori infection is likely a surrogate for poor hygiene and not an important source of antigens involved in the hygiene hypothesis. Helicobacter pylori in Malays is related to transmission from H. pylori-infected non-Malay immigrants. The factors responsible for low H. pylori acquisition, transmission, and burden of H. pylori infection in Malays remain unclear and likely involves a combination of environmental, host (gene polymorphisms), and strain virulence factors. Based on evidence from this population, absence of H. pylori infection is more likely to be boon than a bane.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the genomic diversity of H. pylori strains resulting in heteroresistant antibacterial phenotypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one pairs of H. pylori strains isolated from the antrum and body displaying heteroresistant antibacterial phenotypes were included. We compared the genotypes of paired-isolates by random arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (PCR), flagella gene PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism, and flaA gene sequencing. In metronidazole-heteroresistant isolates, the sequence variation of rdxA and frxA genes was analyzed using phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: The DNA fingerprinting patterns of the paired isolates revealed that 12 pairs (57.1\%) were identical, whereas one pair (3.8\%) was different. The remaining eight pairs (38.1\%) of isolates showed minor heterogenecity in fingerprinting patterns. In flaA gene sequencing, these identical and similar isolates showed close sequence similarity between the antrum and body, whereas different isolate showed 31 points of different nucleotide sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the metronidazole-heteroresistant pairs showed consistent genetic relatedness of each paired isolates despite the sequence variation of the rdxA or frxA genes in five pairs (71.4\%). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that continuing genomic diversities in the same strain may play an important role in modulating the antibiotic-heteroresistant H. pylori in vivo.},

METHODS: We examined the expression of uPAR mRNA and IL-8 mRNA using Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR in 35 gastric carcinomas and the surrounding normal mucosa. Macroscopic and histopathological tumor findings and survival rates were obtained from the patient records. RESULTS: uPAR and IL-8 mRNA expression levels were higher in most neoplasms compared to the corresponding normal mucosal tissue. A correlation between uPAR and IL-8 expression in tumors was observed (r = 0.447, p {$<$} 0.01). uPAR mRNA expression in the tumors correlated well with lymph node metastasis (p {$<$} 0.02), and its stage (p {$<$} 0.01). The IL-8 MRNA expression in the tumors correlated with diffuse-type gastric cancer (p {$<$} 0.05). The survival rates of patients with tumors displaying high uPAR expression levels were significantly lower (p {$<$} 0.04) than those of patients without uPAR expression, but patients with IL-8 expression only showed a tendency to a lower survival rate. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that uPAR and IL-8 may be important prognostic factors in human gastric carcinomas.},

  abstract = {Chronic inflammation induced by Helicobacter pylori infection is a critical factor in the development of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. Central to this inflammation is the initiation of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades within epithelial cells, in particular those mediated by two sensors of bacterial cell wall components, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (NOD1) and alpha-protein kinase 1 (ALPK1). H pylori is, however, also highly adept at mitigating inflammation in the host, thereby restricting tissue damage and favoring bacterial persistence. H~pylori modulates host immune responses by altering cytokine signaling in epithelial and myeloid cells, which results in increased proliferation of regulatory T cells and downregulation of effector T-cell responses. H pylori vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) has been shown to play an important role in the dampening of immune responses and induction of immune tolerance capable of protecting against asthma. It is also possible to generate protective immune responses by immunization with various H~pylori antigens or their epitopes, in combination with an adjuvant, though this for now has only been shown in mouse models. Novel non-toxic adjuvants, consisting of modified bacterial enterotoxins or nanoparticles, have recently been developed that may not only enhance vaccine efficacy, but also help translate candidate vaccines to the clinic. This review will summarize the main discoveries in the past year regarding host immune responses to H~pylori infection, as well as the design of new vaccine approaches against this infection.},

Both nTreg cells and iTreg cells have their own, non-redundant roles in the immune system, with nTreg cells mainly maintaining tolerance toward self-structures, and iTreg developing in response to externally delivered antigens or commensal microbes.

  abstract = {Several guidelines recommend the screen-and-treat strategy, i.e. active search for the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection and its eradication to prevent the possibility of gastric cancer. It is thought that a relatively short duration antibiotic regimen given once in a lifetime would not significantly increase overall antibiotic consumption. However, this would mean offering antibiotic treatment to the majority of the population in countries with the biggest burden of gastric cancer who would, therefore, have the greatest benefit from such a strategy. So far, no country has implemented an eradication strategy. With an example based on the current situation in Latvia, we have estimated the increase in antibiotic consumption if the screen-and-treat strategy was applied. Depending on the scenario that might be chosen, clarithromycin consumption would increase up to sixfold, and amoxicillin consumption would double if the recommendations of the current guideline in the local circumstances was applied. It appears that an increase in commonly used antibiotic consumption cannot be justified from the viewpoint of antibiotic stewardship policies. Solutions to this problem could be the use of antibiotics that are not required for treating life-threatening diseases or more narrow selection of the target group, e.g. young people before family planning to avoid transmission to offspring. Additional costs related to the increase in resistome should be considered for future cost-effectiveness modelling of the screen-and-treat strategy.},

As we discuss, IL-21 has pleiotropic actions, from augmenting the proliferation of T cells and driving the differentiation of B cells into memory cells and terminally differentiated plasma cells to augmenting the activity of natural killer cells. Moreover, it has antitumour activity and might have a role in the development of autoimmunity, so these findings have implications for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases.},

  abstract = {Gastric infection with Helicobacter pylori is one of the most common chronic infections in humans, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of H. pylori infection usually involves upper endoscopy with biopsy since the only noninvasive method of comparable accuracy, the [(13)C]urea breath test, requires technical equipment that is not available in most gastroenterological units. Serological methods for detection of H. pylori infection have reached sufficient accuracy to be used as screening tests before endoscopy or for seroepidemiological surveys. In the present study we evaluated different interpretation criteria for use with immunoglobulin G immunoblotting for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. We applied five different sets of interpretation criteria, four of which had been published previously, to the Western blot results of 294 patients with different gastrointestinal symptoms. Since it is known that less than 2\% of patients who are infected with H. pylori fail to seroconvert, an optimally sensitive Western blotting system should be able to detect approximately 98\% of active infections. When the different criteria were applied to our patient population, it became apparent that the abilities of the systems to detect active H. pylori infection were quite varied. The results for the sensitivity and specificity, according to the different applied criteria, ranged from 62.8 to 95.9\% and from 85.7 to 100.0\%, respectively. Positive predictive values and negative predictive values, according to the published criteria, ranged from 97.2 to 100.0\% and from 37.7 to 82.4\%, respectively. Recommendations for the optimal use of the different interpretation criteria are discussed.},

This review explores mechanisms C. jejuni and H. pylori employ to control flagellar biosynthesis and chemotactic responses. These microbes tightly control the activities of {$\sigma$}(54) and {$\sigma$}(28) to mediate ordered flagellar gene expression. In addition to phase-variable and posttranslational mechanisms, flagellar biosynthesis is regulated spatially and numerically so that only a certain number of organelles are placed at polar sites. To mediate chemotaxis, C. jejuni and H. pylori combine basic chemotaxis signal transduction components with several accessory proteins. H. pylori is unusual in that it lacks a methylation-based adaptation system and produces multiple CheV coupling proteins. Chemoreceptors in these bacteria contain nonconserved ligand binding domains, with several chemoreceptors matched to environmental signals. Together, these mechanisms allow for swimming motility that is essential for colonization.},

Lpp20 is one of major protective antigens which trigger immune response after H.~pylori invades host and has been considered as an excellent vaccine candidate for the control of H.~pylori infection. In our previous study, one B-cell epitope and two CD4(+) T-cell epitopes of Lpp20 were identified. OBJECTIVE: In this study, an epitope vaccine composed of mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and these three identified Lpp20 epitopes were constructed to investigate the efficacy of this epitope vaccine in mice. METHODS: The epitope vaccine including CTB, one B-cell, and two CD4(+) T-cell epitopes of Lpp20 was constructed and named CTB-Lpp20, which was then expressed in Escherichia coli and used for intraperitoneal immunization in BALB/c mice. The immunogenicity, specificity, and ability to induce antibodies against Lpp20 and cytokine secretion were evaluated. After that, CTB-Lpp20 was intragastrically immunized to investigate the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in infected mice. RESULTS: The results indicated that the epitope vaccine CTB-Lpp20 possessed good immunogenicity and immunoreactivity and could elicit specific high level of antibodies against Lpp20 and the cytokine of IFN-{$\gamma$} and IL-17. Additionally, CTB-Lpp20 significantly decreased H.~pylori colonization in H.~pylori challenging mice, and the protection was correlated with IgG, IgA, and sIgA antibody and Th1-type cytokines. CONCLUSION: This study will be better for understanding the protective immunity of epitope vaccine, and CTB-Lpp20 may be an alternative strategy for combating H.~pylori invasion.},

It has been well proved that Lpp20 is one of major protective antigens that induce immune responses after H.pylori invades host. Therefore it is valuable to identify CD4+ T cell epitopes on Lpp20, which is uncharacterized. METHODS: Putative epitopes of H-2d restricted CD4+ T cell on Lpp20 of H.pylori were predicted by the SYFPEITHI algorithm and then eight hypothetical epitope peptides were synthesized. After BALB/c mice were primed with recombinant Lpp20, splenic CD4+ T cells were isolated and stimulated with synthesized peptides to measure T cell proliferation and MHC restriction. Cytokine profile was determined by ELISA and real-time PCR. Two identified epitopes were used to immunize mice to investigate CD4+ T cell response by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Two of eight peptides were able to stimulate CD4+ T cell proliferation and were mapped to residues 83-97aa and 58-72aa on Lpp20 respectively. These two peptides additively stimulated Th1 cells to secrete IFN-{$\gamma$}. The percentage of CD4+ T cell from mice immunized with two identified epitopes respectively was higher than the control group. CONCLUSION: The identification and characterization of two CD4+ T cell epitopes of Lpp20 helps understand the protective immunity of Lpp20 in H.pylori infection and design effective epitope vaccines against H.pylori.},

The extent to which they contribute to innate immunity is, however, unknown. We used a mouse model of acute kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) to test the hypothesis that early production of IL-23 and IL-12 following IRI activates downstream IL-17 and IFN-gamma signaling pathways and promotes kidney inflammation. Deficiency in IL-23, IL-17A, or IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) and mAb neutralization of CXCR2, the p19 subunit of IL-23, or IL-17A attenuated neutrophil infiltration in acute kidney IRI in mice. We further demonstrate that IL-17A produced by GR-1+ neutrophils was critical for kidney IRI in mice. Activation of the IL-12/IFN-gamma pathway and NKT cells by administering alpha-galactosylceramide-primed bone marrow-derived DCs increased IFN-gamma production following moderate IRI in WT mice but did not exacerbate injury or enhance IFN-gamma production in either Il17a-/- or Il17r-/- mice, which suggested that IL-17 signaling was proximal to IFN-gamma signaling. This was confirmed by the finding that IFN-gamma administration reversed the protection seen in Il17a-/- mice subjected to IRI, whereas IL-17A failed to reverse protection in Ifng-/- mice. These results demonstrate that the innate immune component of kidney IRI requires dual activation of the IL-12/IFN-gamma and IL-23/IL-17 signaling pathways and that neutrophil production of IL-17A is upstream of IL-12/IFN-gamma. These mechanisms might contribute to reperfusion injury in other organs.},

Using experimental database mining and statistical analysis methods we developed, we examined the tissue expression profiles and regulatory mechanisms of IL-35 in comparison to other anti-inflammatory cytokines. Our results suggest that in contrast to TGF-{$\beta$}, IL-35 is not constitutively expressed in human tissues but it is inducible in response to inflammatory stimuli. We also provide structural evidence that AU-rich element (ARE) binding proteins and microRNAs target IL-35 subunit transcripts, by which IL-35 may achieve non-constitutive expression status. Furthermore, we propose a new system to categorize anti-inflammatory cytokines into two groups: (1) the house-keeping cytokines, such as TGF-{$\beta$}, inhibit the initiation of inflammation whereas (2) the responsive cytokines including IL-35 suppress inflammation in full-blown stage. Our in-depth analyses of molecular events that regulate the production of IL-35 as well as the new categorization system of anti-inflammatory cytokines are important for the design of new strategies of immune therapies.},

Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit urease B enzymatic activity will be useful as vaccines for the prevention and treatment of H. pylori infection. Here, we produced murine mAbs against urease B that neutralize the enzyme's activity. We mapped their epitopes by phage display libraries and investigated the immunogenicity of the selected mimotopes in vivo. RESULTS: The urease B gene was obtained (GenBank accession No. DQ141576) and the recombinant pGEX-4T-1/UreaseB protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as a 92-kDa recombinant fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Five mAbs U001-U005 were produced by a hybridoma-based technique with urease B-GST as an immunogen. Only U001 could inhibit urease B enzymatic activity. Immunoscreening via phage display libraries revealed two different mimotopes of urease B protein; EXXXHDM from ph.D.12-library and EXXXHSM from ph.D.C7C that matched the urease B proteins at 347-353 aa. The antiserum induced by selected phage clones clearly recognised the urease B protein and inhibited its enzymatic activity, which indicated that the phagotope-induced immune responses were antigen specific. CONCLUSIONS: The present work demonstrated that phage-displayed mimotopes were accessible to the mouse immune system and triggered a humoral response. The urease B mimotope could provide a novel and promising approach for the development of a vaccine for the diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori infection.},

  abstract = {The heterodimeric cytokine interleukin-23 (IL-23 or IL23A/IL12B) is produced by dendritic cells and macrophages and promotes the proinflammatory and regenerative activities of T helper 17 (Th17) and innate lymphoid cells. A recent study has reported that IL-23 is also secreted by lung adenoma cells and generates an inflammatory and immune-suppressed stroma. Here, we observed that proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/NF-{$\kappa$}B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling strongly induce IL23A expression in intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, we identified a strong crosstalk between the NF-{$\kappa$}B and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) pathways, involving the formation of a transcriptional enhancer complex consisting of proto-oncogene c-Jun (c-Jun), RELA proto-oncogene NF-{$\kappa$}B subunit (RelA), RUNX family transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), and RUNX3. Collectively, these proteins induced IL23A secretion, confirmed by immunoprecipitation of endogenous IL23A from activated human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell culture supernatants. Interestingly, IL23A was likely secreted in a noncanonical form, as it was not detected by an ELISA specific for heterodimeric IL-23 likely because IL12B expression is absent in CRC cells. Given recent evidence that IL23A promotes tumor formation, we evaluated the efficacy of MAPK/NF-{$\kappa$}B inhibitors in attenuating IL23A expression and found that the MEK inhibitor trametinib and BAY 11-7082 (an IKK{$\alpha$}/I{$\kappa$}B inhibitor) effectively inhibited IL23A in a subset of human CRC lines with mutant KRAS or BRAFV600E mutations. Together, these results indicate that proinflammatory and mitogenic signals dynamically regulate IL23A in epithelial cells. They further reveal its secretion in a noncanonical form independent of IL12B and that small-molecule inhibitors can attenuate IL23A secretion.},

  abstract = {Gastric epithelial cells (GECs) are the primary target for Helicobacter pylori infection and may act as APCs regulating local T cell responses. We previously reported that H. pylori infection of GECs induces the expression of the T cell coinhibitory molecule B7-H1 on GECs. This process contributes to the hyporesponsiveness of CD4(+) effector T cells and accumulation of regulatory T cells. In the present study, we investigated the impact of H. pylori cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) on the modulation of the expression of the T cell costimulator B7-H2 by GECs. B7-H2 is involved in promoting Th17 type responses. H. pylori infection downregulates B7-H2 expression by GECs in a CagA-dependent manner. IFN-{$\gamma$}, which is increased in the H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa, synergizes with H. pylori in downregulating B7-H2 expression by GECs. CagA-mediated modulation of B7-H2 on GECs involves p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation. The CagA-dependent B7-H2 downregulation in GECs correlates with a decrease in Th17 type responses in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, CagA-dependent modulation of Th17 responses was inversely correlated with the H. pylori colonization levels in vivo. Our data suggest that CagA contributes to the ability of H. pylori to evade Th17-mediated clearance by modulating expression of B7-H2 and, thus, to the establishment of the H. pylori chronic infection.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori causes gastritis, peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. The microbe is found in the gastric mucus layer where a pH gradient ranging from acidic in the lumen to neutral at the cell surface is maintained. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of pH on H. pylori binding to gastric mucins from healthy individuals. At pH 3, all strains bound to the most charged MUC5AC glycoform and to a putative mucin of higher charge and larger size than subunits of MUC5AC and MUC6, irrespective of host blood-group. In contrast, at pH 7.4 only Le(b)-binding BabA-positive strains bound to Le(b)-positive MUC5AC and to smaller mucin-like molecules, including MUC1. H. pylori binding to the latter component(s) seems to occur via the H-type-1 structure. All strains bound to a proteoglycan containing chondroitin sulphate/dermatan sulphate side chains at acidic pH, whereas binding to secreted MUC5AC and putative membrane-bound strains occurred both at neutral and acidic pH. The binding properties at acidic pH are thus common to all H. pylori strains, whereas mucin binding at neutral pH occurs via the bacterial BabA adhesin and the Le(b) antigen/related structures on the glycoprotein. Our work shows that microbe binding to membrane-bound mucins must be considered in H. pylori colonization, and the potential of these glycoproteins to participate in signalling events implies that microbe binding to such structures may initiate signal transduction over the epithelial layer. Competition between microbe binding to membrane-bound and secreted mucins is therefore an important aspect of host-microbe interaction.},

  abstract = {The bacterium Helicobacter pylori can cause peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma and MALT lymphoma. The cell-surface mucin MUC1 is a large glycoprotein which is highly expressed on the mucosal surface and limits the density of H. pylori in a murine infection model. We now demonstrate that by using the BabA and SabA adhesins, H. pylori bind MUC1 isolated from human gastric cells and MUC1 shed into gastric juice. Both H. pylori carrying these adhesins, and beads coated with MUC1 antibodies, induced shedding of MUC1 from MKN7 human gastric epithelial cells, and shed MUC1 was found bound to H. pylori. Shedding of MUC1 from non-infected cells was not mediated by the known MUC1 sheddases ADAM17 and MMP-14. However, knockdown of MMP-14 partially affected MUC1 release early in infection, whereas ADAM17 had no effect. Thus, it is likely that shedding is mediated both by proteases and by disassociation of the non-covalent interaction between the alpha- and beta-subunits. H. pylori bound more readily to MUC1 depleted cells even when the bacteria lacked the BabA and SabA adhesins, showing that MUC1 inhibits attachment even when bacteria cannot bind to the mucin. Bacteria lacking both the BabA and SabA adhesins caused less apoptosis in MKN7 cells than wild-type bacteria, having a greater effect than deletion of the CagA pathogenicity gene. Deficiency of MUC1/Muc1 resulted in increased epithelial cell apoptosis, both in MKN7 cells in vitro, and in H. pylori infected mice. Thus, MUC1 protects the epithelium from non-MUC1 binding bacteria by inhibiting adhesion to the cell surface by steric hindrance, and from MUC1-binding bacteria by acting as a releasable decoy.},

In this study we have analyzed the local response of different cytokines-i.e., the proinflammatory interleukin-1beta, (IL-1beta), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-8; the immunoregulatory gamma interferon (IFN-gamma); and IL-4; and the anti-inflammatory transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-in antral biopsy specimens from H. pylori-infected duodenal ulcer (DU) patients and asymptomatic (AS) carriers (i.e., with chronic gastritis only). For comparison, biopsy specimens from uninfected healthy individuals were also analyzed. An immunohistochemical technique was used to allow quantification of the cytokine responses as well as identification of the cell types associated with the cytokine expression. We found that the levels of all of the studied cytokines except IL-4 were increased in the H. pylori-infected subjects compared to the levels in the healthy individuals. Our results indicate that the antral cytokine response is of the Th1 type since IFN-gamma, but not IL-4, was up-regulated both in H. pylori-infected DU patients and in AS carriers. However, there were no significant differences in either proinflammatory or immunoregulatory cytokine levels when H. pylori-infected subjects with and without peptic ulcers were compared. Some of the cytokines, particularly IL-1beta and TGF-beta, were also found in the gastric mucosae of healthy, uninfected subjects. We also showed that the gastric epithelium contributes substantially to the antral cytokine response of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6 in addition to IL-8.},

However, the frequency and importance of H. pylori transmission between adults is underestimated. Here we sequenced the complete genomes of H. pylori strains that were transmitted between spouses and analysed the genomic changes. Similar to H. pylori from chronic infection, a significantly high proportion of the determined 31 SNPs and 10 recombinant DNA fragments affected genes of the hop family of outer membrane proteins, some of which are known to be adhesins. In addition, changes in a fucosyltransferase gene modified the LPS component of the bacterial cell surface, suggesting strong diversifying selection. In contrast, virulence factor genes were not affected by the genomic changes. We propose a model of the genomic changes that are associated with the transmission and adaptation of H. pylori to a new human host.},

Here, we report a novel mechanism of prolonged intracellular TKI activity upon HD-TKI pulse-exposure (imatinib, dasatinib) in BCR-ABL-positive cells. Comprehensive mechanistic exploration revealed dramatic intracellular accumulation of TKIs which closely correlated with induction of apoptosis. Cells were rescued from apoptosis upon HD-TKI pulse either by repetitive drug wash-out or by overexpression of ABC-family drug transporters. Inhibition of ABCB1 restored sensitivity to HD-TKI pulse-exposure. Thus, our data provide evidence that intracellular drug retention crucially determines biological activity of imatinib and dasatinib. These studies may refine our current thinking on critical requirements of TKI dose and duration of target inhibition for biological activity of TKIs.},

Human runt-associated transcription factor 3 gene (RUNX3) has been reported to participate in various inflammatory diseases. However, the exact role of RUNX3 in SAP and its-related ALI remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To establish the model of SAP, rats were retrogradely injected with 5\% sodium taurocholate (1 mg/kg body weight) into the biliary-pancreatic duct. Cytokine level in serum was measured by ELISA, and the polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) was isolated from rat's blood 12 h-post SAP induction. RESULTS: We found RUNX3 expression was significantly decreased with the progression of SAP. Both pancreas damages and cytokine production abilities were reduced in RUXN3-overexpressed SAP rats compared with control rats. Moreover, SAP-associated ALI was also improved upon RUNX3 overexpression in SAP rats. RUNX3 upregulation enhanced PMN apoptosis and inhibited Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that RUNX3 protects against SAP and SAP-associated ALI through controlling PMN apoptosis and regulating JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. RUNX3 could be regarded as a potent therapeutic target in SAP for future studies.},

We constructed an epitope-based vaccine, designated Epivac, which was composed of predicted immunodominant CD4+ T cell epitopes from H. pylori adhesin A (HpaA), urease B (UreB) and cytotoxin-associated gene A product (CagA). Together with four different Th1 adjuvants, Epivac was administered subcutaneously and the prophylactic potential was examined. Compared to non-immunized mice, immunization with Epivac alone or with a Th1 adjuvant significantly reduced H. pylori colonization, and better protection was observed when an adjuvant was used. Immunized mice exhibited a strong local and systemic Th1-biased immune response, which may contribute to the inhibition of H. pylori colonization. Though a significant specific antibody response was induced by the vaccine, no correlation was found between the intensity of the humoral response and the protective effect.

  abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-23, a new member of the IL-12 family, plays a central role in the Th17 immune response and in autoimmune diseases. It is clear that activated macrophages and dendritic cells produce IL-23, but the molecular mechanisms whereby inflammatory signals stimulate IL-23 expression are not fully understood. We demonstrate that induction of IL-23 p19 gene expression by LPS depends on the TLR4 and MyD88 pathways. All three MAPK pathways (ERK, JNK, and p38) that are activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation were shown to exert a positive effect on p19 expression. We cloned a 1.3-kb putative p19 promoter and defined its transcription initiation sites by the 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method. By analyzing IL-23 p19 promoter mutants, we have identified a promoter region (-413 to +10) that contains several important elements, including NF-kappaB and AP-1. In addition to NF-kappaB, we have demonstrated that the proximal AP-1 site is important for p19 promoter activation. Mutation of the AP-1 site resulted in the loss of p19 promoter activation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis showed that c-Jun and c-Fos bind to the AP-1 site, which was confirmed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Furthermore, co-transfection of c-Jun and ATF2 synergistically induced p19 promoter activation, and c-Jun and ATF2 formed a protein complex, demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Finally, LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from IL-10-deficient mice expressed significantly higher IL-23 p19 than macrophages from wild type mice, and the addition of recombinant IL-10 strongly inhibited LPS-induced p19 expression. Thus, this study suggests that MyD88-dependent Toll-like receptor signaling induces IL-23 p19 gene expression through both MAPKs and NF-kappaB.},

We examined whether forced expression of the p28-linked EBI3 gene in human oesophageal carcinoma cells (Eca109) produced antitumour effects in a T cell-defective condition. Tumour growth of Eca109 cells expressing IL-27 (Eca109/IL-27) was retarded in nude mice compared with parental and vector DNA-transduced tumours and survival of the mice inoculated with Eca109/IL-27 cells was prolonged. Expression of the tumour necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 genes was up-regulated in Eca109/IL-27 tumour specimens while the tumours remained small in size but the increased transcription was subsequently down-regulated in enlarged tumours. Spleen cells from mice-bearing Eca109/IL-27 tumours produced interferon-gamma and showed YAC-1-targeted cytotoxic activities greater than those of mice inoculated with parental or vector DNA-transducer tumours. Numbers of DX5+CD69+ natural killer cells in spleen of mice-bearing Eca109/IL-27 tumours and those of CD31+ cells within Eca109/IL-27 tumours remained the same as found in mice-bearing parental or vector DNA-transduced tumours. These data collectively suggest that the IL-27-mediated antitumour effects produced in a mature T cell-defective condition were attributable to enhanced interferon-gamma production and natural killer activities.},

It is produced by antigen-presenting cells and plays a critical role in host defense against intracellular microbial infection and control of malignancy via its ability to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune effector cells. The potency of IL-12 renders itself to stringent regulation of the timing, locality and magnitude of its production during an immune response. Subversion of the delicate control and balance frequently leads to immunologic disorders. In this article, we provide an update, since our last review of the subject four years ago, on recent advances in: (1) uncovering of novel activities of IL-12 and related molecules in various immunological settings and models; and (2) dissection of the physiological pathways involved in the modulation of IL-12 production by pathogens and immune regulators. The increased understanding of IL-12 immunobiology and expression will likely benefit the development of therapeutic modalities to correct immune dysfunctions.},

IL-27 is an early product of activated monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells. However, the mechanisms whereby inflammatory signals stimulate IL-27 production have not been explored. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the mouse IL-27 p28 gene in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon (IFN)-{$\gamma$}.

Activation of the mucosal immune response has the important function of containing an infection and preventing dissemination of pathogens to systemic sites (barrier function). Numerous lines of evidence suggest that the barrier function is orchestrated by a subset of cytokines (interleukin (IL-)17 and IL-22), which belong to the Th17 family. IL-17 and IL-22 induce expression of antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil chemoattractants at mucosal sites, and thus play an important role in controlling mucosal infections. However, there is increasing evidence that mucosal pathogens achieve greater colonization during inflammation because they are resistant to a subset of these antimicrobial responses. In this review we compare the antimicrobial responses elicited by Th17 cytokines during mucosal infections with four different pathogens: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter rodentium, Candida albicans and Salmonella typhimurium. We will then discuss which responses may constitute the mucosal barrier, thus providing a benefit to the host, and which ones may promote the colonization of pathogens, thereby providing a benefit to the microbes.},

Oral therapeutic immunization with attenuated Salmonella, which expressed the fused protein CVU, significantly decreased H. pylori colonization in the stomach; protection was related to specific CD4(+) T cell Th1 type responses and serum IgG and mucosal sIgA antibody responses. These findings suggested that therapeutic efficacy was related to the arrangement of the fusion protein. It is possible that arrangement decides the expression of recombinant antigen in mice, and the latter results in different therapeutic efficacy.

We report here that RORgamma t(+) T alphabeta cells include Foxp3(+) cells that coexist with IL-17-producing RORgamma t(+) T alphabeta cells in all tissues examined. The Foxp3(+) RORgamma t(+) T alphabeta express IL-10 and CCL20, and function as regulatory T cells. Furthermore, the ratio of Foxp3(+) to IL-17-producing RORgamma t(+) T alphabeta cells remains remarkably constant in mice enduring infection and inflammation. This equilibrium is tuned in favor of IL-10 production by Foxp3 and CCL20, and in favor of IL-17 production by IL-6 and IL-23. In the lung and skin, the largest population of RORgamma t(+) T cells express the gammadelta T cell receptor and produce the highest levels of IL-17 independently of IL-6. Thus, potentially antagonistic proinflammatory IL-17-producing and regulatory Foxp3(+) RORgamma t(+) T cells coexist and are tightly controlled, suggesting that a perturbed equilibrium in RORgamma t(+) T cells might lead to decreased immunoreactivity or, in contrast, to pathological inflammation.},

Although much effort has been put into the development of a Helicobacter pylori vaccine over the last three decades, none has yet reached clinical application. Specific challenges pertaining to effective H. pylori vaccine development include the lack of proven vaccine-effective antigens and safe mucosal adjuvants to enhance local immune responses as well as the lack of accepted correlates of protection. Herein, we demonstrate that prophylactic intragastric immunisation with a whole-cell killed H. pylori antigen administered together with the non-toxic oral adjuvant {$\alpha$}-galactosylceramide ({$\alpha$}-GalCer) induced effective immune protection against H. pylori infection in mice, which was of similar magnitude as when using the "gold standard" cholera toxin as adjuvant. We further describe that this {$\alpha$}-GalCer-adjuvanted vaccine formulation elicited strong intestinal and systemic Th1 responses as well as significant antigen-specific mucosal and systemic antibody responses. Finally, we report that the protective intestinal Th1 responses induced by {$\alpha$}-GalCer are dependent on CD1d, IL-1R as well as IL-17R signalling. In summary, our results show that {$\alpha$}-GalCer is a promising adjuvant for inclusion in an oral vaccine against H. pylori infection.},

Here, we show that human Th17 cells endowed with suppressor activity (supTh17) can be derived following exposure of iT-reg populations to Th17 polarizing conditions. In contrast to "pathogenic" Th17, supTh17 display immune suppressive function and express high levels of CD39, an ectonucleotidase that catalyzes the conversion of pro-inflammatory extracellular nucleotides ultimately generating nucleosides. Accordingly, supTh17 exhibit nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase activity, as demonstrated by the efficient generation of extracellular AMP, adenosine and other purine derivatives. In addition supTh17 cells are resistant to the effects of adenosine as result of the low expression of the A2A receptor and accelerated adenosine catalysis by adenosine deaminase (ADA). These supTh17 can be detected in the blood and in the lamina propria of healthy subjects. However, these supTh17 cells are diminished in patients with Crohn's disease. In summary, we describe a human Th17 subpopulation with suppressor activity, which expresses high levels of CD39 and consequently produces extracellular adenosine. As these uniquely suppressive CD39(+) Th17 cells are decreased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, our findings might have implications for the development of novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches in these and potentially other immune disorders.},

Further, colonic ILC3 from patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease had increased IL-22 production. IBD-associated SNP gene set analysis revealed enrichment for genes selectively expressed in human intestinal MNPs. The product of one of these, TL1A, potently enhanced IL-23- and IL-1{$\beta$}-induced production of IL-22 and GM-CSF by ILC3.

  abstract = {Considering the recommended indications for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy and the broad spectrum of available diagnostic methods, a reliable diagnosis is mandatory both before and after eradication therapy. Only highly accurate tests should be used in clinical practice, and the sensitivity and specificity of an adequate test should exceed 90\%. The choice of tests should take into account clinical circumstances, the likelihood ratio of positive and negative tests, the cost-effectiveness of the testing strategy and the availability of the tests. This review concerns some of the most recent developments in diagnostic methods of H. pylori infection, namely the contribution of novel endoscopic evaluation methodologies for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection, such as magnifying endoscopy techniques and chromoendoscopy. In addition, the diagnostic contribution of histology and the urea breath test was explored recently in specific clinical settings and patient groups. Recent studies recommend enhancing the number of biopsy fragments for the rapid urease test. Bacterial culture from the gastric biopsy is the gold standard technique, and is recommended for antibiotic susceptibility test. Serology is used for initial screening and the stool antigen test is particularly used when the urea breath test is not available, while molecular methods have gained attention mostly for detecting antibiotic resistance.},

TCCR/WSX-1 deficiency results in delayed T helper type 1 (TH1) development through an unresolved mechanism. We report here that IL-27 stimulation in developing murine T helper cells potently induces the expression of the major TH1-specific transcription factor T-bet and its downstream target IL-12R beta2, independently of IFN gamma. In addition, IL-27 suppresses basal expression of GATA-3, the critical TH2-specific transcription factor that inhibits TH1 development by down-regulating signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 4. IL-27 signaling through TCCR/WSX-1 induces phosphorylation of Stat1, Stat3, Stat4, and Stat5. Stat1 is required for suppression of GATA-3, but T-bet induction by IL-27 can also be mediated through a Stat1-independent pathway. Despite its TH1-like signaling profile, IL-27 is not sufficient to drive the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into IFN gamma-producing cells. Similarly, IL-27 induces T-bet expression in primary natural killer cells, but this does not result in an increase of IFN gamma production or cytotoxic activity. Therefore, although IL-27 is unable to drive IFN gamma production on its own, it plays an important role in the early steps of TH1 commitment by contributing in a paracrine manner to the control of IL-12 responsiveness.},

High genetic diversity and rapid microevolution are a hallmark of H. pylori genomes, a phenomenon that is proposed to play a functional role in persistence and colonization of diverse human populations. To provide further genomic evidence in the lineage of H. pylori and to further characterize diverse strains of this pathogen in different human populations, we report the finished genome sequence of Sahul64, an H. pylori strain isolated from an indigenous Australian. Our analysis identified genes that were highly divergent compared to the 38 publically available genomes, which include genes involved in the biosynthesis and modification of lipopolysaccharide, putative prophage genes, restriction modification components, and hypothetical genes. Furthermore, the virulence-associated vacA locus is a pseudogene and the cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI) is not present. However, the genome does contain a gene cluster associated with pathogenicity, including dupA. Our analysis found that with the addition of Sahul64 to the 38 genomes, the core genome content of H. pylori is reduced by approximately 14\% ({$\sim$}170 genes) and the pan-genome has expanded from 2,070 to 2,238 genes. We have identified three putative horizontally acquired regions, including one that is likely to have been acquired from the closely related Helicobacter cetorum prior to speciation. Our results suggest that Sahul64, with the absence of cagPAI, highly divergent cell envelope proteins, and a predicted nontransportable VacA protein, could be more highly adapted to ancient indigenous Australian people but with lower virulence potential compared to other sequenced and cagPAI-positive H. pylori strains.},

Microorganisms can activate the expression of iNOS and the production of NO by macrophages through stimulation with bacterial LPS. Helicobacter pylori can evade these vigorous immune responses, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we used a murine model of macrophage infection to demonstrate that H. pylori inhibits LPS-induced expression of iNOS and production of NO by macrophages. Suppression of LPS-induced NO production by macrophages led to elevated survival of H. pylori in a trans-well system. This effect was abrogated in macrophages from iNOS(-/-) mice. Analysis of iNOS mRNA and protein levels revealed that H. pylori inhibits iNOS expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and that these effects occurred with live bacteria. Furthermore, the effect of H. pylori involved down-regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and the translocation of active NF-{$\kappa$}B into the nucleus. Taken together, our results reveal a new mechanism by which H. pylori modulates the innate immune responses of the host and maintains a persistent infection within the stomach.},

We hypothesized that the inability to clear the infection may be a consequence of H. pylori-specific regulatory T cells that actively suppress T-cell responses. Therefore, we characterized the T-cell responses to H. pylori in H. pylori-infected individuals without any subjective symptoms and in uninfected control subjects and investigated the role of regulatory CD4+ CD25(high) T cells during infection. The stimulation of CD4+ peripheral blood T cells with monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with a membrane preparation of H. pylori resulted in proliferation and gamma interferon production in both infected and uninfected individuals. Sorted memory cells from infected individuals responded less than cells from uninfected subjects, and the unresponsiveness could be abolished by depletion of CD4+ CD25(high) regulatory T cells or the addition of interleukin 2. Furthermore, CD4+ CD25(high) T cells suppressed H. pylori-induced responses in cocultures with CD25(low/-) cells. Tetanus toxoid induced comparable responses in memory cells from infected and uninfected individuals in both the presence and the absence of regulatory T cells, suggesting that the suppression was H. pylori specific. In conclusion, we have shown that H. pylori-infected individuals have impaired memory CD4+ T-cell responses to H. pylori that are linked to the presence of H. pylori-specific regulatory T cells that actively suppress the responses.},

  abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-23 is a recently identified member of the IL-12 family of heterodimeric cytokines that modulate subpopulations of T helper cells, and both IL-12 and IL-23 are attractive targets for therapy of autoimmune diseases. IL-23 is a binary complex of a four-helix bundle cytokine (p19) and a soluble class I cytokine receptor p40. IL-12 and IL-23 share p40 as an alpha-receptor subunit, yet show only 15\% sequence homology between their four-helix cytokines p19 and p35, respectively, and signal through different combinations of shared receptors. In order to elucidate the structural basis of p40 sharing, we have determined a 2.3-A crystal structure of IL-23 for comparison to the previously determined structure of IL-12. The docking mode of p19 to p40 is altered compared to p35, deviating by a 'tilt' and 'roll' that results in an altered footprint of p40 on the A and D helices of the respective cytokines. Binding of p19 to p40 is mediated primarily by an arginine residue on helix D of p19 that forms an extensive charge and hydrogen-bonding network with residues at the base of a pocket on p40. This 'arginine pocket' is lined with an inner shell of hydrophobic interactions that are ringed by an outer shell of polar interactions. Comparative analysis indicates that the IL-23 and IL-12 complexes 'mimic' the network of interactions constituting the central arginine pocket despite p19 and p35 having limited sequence homology. The majority of the structural epitopes in the two complexes are composed of unique p19 and p35 pairwise contacts with common residues on p40. Thus, while the critical hotspot is maintained in the two complexes, the majority of the interfaces are structurally distinct and, therefore, provide a basis for the therapeutic targeting of IL-12 versus IL-23 heterodimer formation despite their use of a common receptor subunit.},

Acetone is used to dissolve the nitrocellulose and to precipitate the adsorbed proteins/peptides, thus removing the nitrocellulose which can interfere with MS analysis. This method offers improved protein coverage, especially for membrane proteins, such as uroplakins, because the extraction step after in-gel digestion is avoided. Moreover, removal of nitrocellulose from the sample solution allows sample analysis by both MALDI- and (LC) ESI-based mass spectrometers.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic data suggest a protective effect of Helicobacter pylori infection against the development of autoimmune disease. Laboratory data illustrate H. pylori's ability to induce immune tolerance and limit inflammatory responses. Numerous observational studies have investigated the association between H. pylori infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our aim was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of this association. METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, bibliographies, and meeting abstracts were searched by 2 independent reviewers. Of 369 abstracts reviewed, 30 promising articles were reviewed in detail. Twenty-three studies met our inclusion criteria (subject N = 5903). Meta-analysis was performed with the metan command in Stata 10.1. RESULTS: Overall, 27.1\% of IBD patients had evidence of infection with H. pylori compared to 40.9\% of patients in the control group. The estimated relative risk of H. pylori infection in IBD patients was 0.64 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-0.75). There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies that could not be accounted for by the method of IBD and H. pylori diagnosis, study location, or study population age. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a protective benefit of H. pylori infection against the development of IBD. Heterogeneity among studies and the possibility of publication bias limit the certainty of this finding. Further studies investigating the effect of eradication of H. pylori on the development of IBD are warranted. Because environmental hygiene and intestinal microbiota may be strong confounders, further mechanistic studies in H. pylori mouse models are also necessary to further define the mechanism of this negative association.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Epidemiological data have recently emerged to suggest Helicobacter pylori may protect against certain chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the mechanism for the observed inverse association between H pylori and IBD has not been described. METHODS: The frequency of immunoregulatory (IRS) to immunostimulatory (ISS) sequences within the genome of various bacteria was calculated using MacVector software. The induction of type I IFN and IL-12 responses by DNA-pulsed murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) and human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC) was analysed by cytokine production. The effect of H pylori DNA on Escherichia coli DNA production of type I IFN and IL-12 was assessed. The in-vivo significance of H pylori DNA suppression was assessed in a dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) model of colitis. The systemic levels of type I IFN were assessed in H pylori-colonised and non-colonised patients. RESULTS: H pylori DNA has a significantly elevated IRS:ISS ratio. In-vitro experiments revealed the inability of H pylori DNA to stimulate type I IFN or IL-12 production from mouse BMDC or human plasmacytoid DC. H pylori DNA was also able to suppress E coli DNA production of type I IFN and IL-12. The administration of H pylori DNA before the induction of DSS colitis significantly ameliorated the severity of colitis compared with E coli DNA or vehicle control in both an acute and chronic model. Finally, the systemic levels of type I IFN were found to be lower in H pylori-colonised patients than non-colonised controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that H pylori DNA has the ability to downregulate pro-inflammatory responses from DC and this may partly explain the inverse association between H pylori and IBD.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS The expression of interferon-gamma, interleukin-12, interleukin-4, interleukin-10, interleukin-8, and interleukin-17 mRNA was examined on gastric mucosal samples from 24 children by semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and southern blotting. Biopsy-based tests, serology, and urea 13C breath test were used to assess Helicobacter pylori status. Gastric biopsies were also evaluated for bacterial density, chronic inflammation, and acute inflammatory activity. RESULTS Interferon-gamma, interleukin-12, interleukin-8 and interleukin-17 expression was higher in Helicobacter pylori-infected (n=13) than uninfected (n=11) children. Conversely, interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 expression did not differ between Helicobacter pylori-infected and uninfected children. In Helicobacter pylori-infected children, interferon-gamma, interleukin-12, interleukin-8 and interleukin-17 expression correlated with bacterial density, and Interferon-gamma and interleukin-12 expression with chronic inflammation score. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study indicate that, in children, Helicobacter pylori-induced inflammatory response would favour production of proinflammatory cytokines and development of cell-mediated immunity, namely Th1 response.},

  abstract = {Tight junctions, paracellular permeability barriers that define epithelial cell polarity, play an essential role in transepithelial transport, cell-cell adhesion and lymphocyte transmigration. They are also important for the maintenance of innate immune defence and intestinal antigen uptake. Ammonium (NH4+) is elevated in the gastric aspirates of Helicobacter pylori-infected patients and has been implicated in the disruption of tight-junction functional integrity and the induction of gastric mucosal damage during H. pylori infection. The precise mechanism of the effect of ammonium and the molecular targets of ammonium in host tissue are not yet identified. To study the effects of ammonium on epithelial tight junctions, the human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2 was cultured on permeable supports and the transepithelial resistance (TER) was measured at different time intervals following exposure to ammonium salts or H. pylori-derived ammonium. A biphasic response to treatment with ammonium was found. Acute exposure to ammonium salts or NH3/NH4+ derived from urea metabolism by wild-type H. pylori resulted in a 20-30 \% decrease in TER. After 24 h, the NH4Cl-treated cells showed a partial recovery of TER. In contrast, the control culture, or cultures that were exposed to supernatants derived from urease-deficient H. pylori, showed no significant decrease in TER. Occludin-specific immunoblots revealed the expression of a low-molecular-weight form of occludin of 42 kDa upon NH3/NH4+ exposure. The results indicate that modulation of tight-junction function by H. pylori is ammonium-dependent and linked to the accumulation of a low-molecular-weight and detergent-soluble form of occludin.},

It has been shown that one point mutation in the 23S rRNA gene is associated with resistance to clarithromycin. AIMS: To establish a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system which amplifies a segment of the 23S rRNA gene containing the mutation points with primers specific for H pylori, so that H pylori infection and the mutation associated with clarithromycin resistance can be examined simultaneously. METHODS: To detect H pylori infection and the mutation simultaneously, primers specific for the H pylori 23S rRNA gene were designed based on sequence conservation among H pylori strains and sequence specificity as compared with other bacteria. DNA from 57 cultured strains and from 39 gastric juice samples was amplified in the seminested 23S rRNA PCR. Clinical applicability was evaluated in 85 patients. RESULTS: DNA samples from 57 cultured strains were all amplified. The novel assay and the urease A PCR agreed in 37/39 gastric juice samples with no false positives. The assay did not amplify the DNA of bacteria other than H pylori. Eight of 85 samples had the mutation before treatment. In clarithromycin based treatment, eradication was achieved in 2/5 (40\%) with the mutation and 29/34 (85\%) without the mutation. CONCLUSION: The assay using gastric juice is quick (within 12 hours) and non-invasive (endoscopy not required), enabling rapid initiation of appropriate antibiotic treatment.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori adhesion to gastric epithelial cells constitutes a key step in the establishment of a successful infection of the gastric mucosa. The high representation of outer membrane proteins in the bacterial genome suggests the relevance of those proteins in the establishment of profitable interactions with the host gastric cells. Gastric epithelial cells are protected by a mucous layer gel, mainly consisting of the MUC5AC and MUC6 mucins. In addition to this protective role, mucins harbor glycan-rich domains that constitute preferential binding sites of many pathogens. In this article we review the main players in the process of H. pylori adhesion to gastric epithelial cells, which contribute decisively to the high prevalence and chronicity of H. pylori infection. The BabA adhesin recognizes both H-type 1 and Lewis b blood-group antigens expressed on normal gastric mucosa of secretor individuals, contributing to the initial steps of infection. Upon colonization, persistent infection induces an inflammatory response with concomitant expression of sialylated antigens. The SabA adhesin mediates H. pylori binding to inflamed gastric mucosa by recognizing sialyl-Lewis a and sialyl-Lewis x antigens. The expression of the BabA and SabA adhesins is tightly regulated, permitting the bacteria to rapidly adapt to the changes of glycosylation of the host gastric mucosa that occur during infection, as well as to escape from the inflammatory response. The growing knowledge of the interactions between the bacterial adhesins and the host receptors will contribute to the design of alternative strategies for eradication of the infection.},

While co-stimulation was previously thought to be indispensable for T cell activation at all stages of development, it is now known that the requirements for co-stimulation, and co-stimulatory molecules involved, vary according to the stage of T cell differentiation. The ability to influence T cell fate is of paramount interest in the field of transplantation as we seek therapeutic options that inhibit detrimental alloimmune responses whilst simultaneously promoting allograft tolerance. As with many immune mechanisms, there is a degree of functional overlap between certain co-stimulatory molecules, while some have diametrically opposite effects on different T cell subsets despite sharing common ligands. This is a critical point when considering these molecules as therapeutic targets in transplantation, as blockade of a co-stimulatory pathway, while desirable in itself, may prevent the ligation of an essential regulatory co-inhibitory molecule. This review discusses the T helper cell lineages pertinent to transplantation and the co-stimulatory molecules involved in their differentiation.},

Significant binding of the parent strain was observed in only 8 out of 22 sections; in four out of eight patients, the Le(x)-negative mutant bound less well. One of these four patients displayed no gastric abnormalities, and the other three showed dysplasia, metaplasia, and adenocarcinoma, respectively; hence, we are unable to define the circumstances under which LPS-mediated adhesion takes place.

Cholera toxin B (CTB) is a mucosal adjuvant that can induce antigen tolerance. Bacillus subtilis spores are an ideal vehicle for the oral delivery of heterologous antigens. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the therapeutic effect of recombinant NAP B~subtilis spores on peanut allergies in a mouse model. METHODS: Female C3H/HeJ mice were sensitized and challenged with peanut extract by oral administration. Before challenge, recombinant NAP and CTB-NAP (CNAP) spores were orally administered to sensitized mice for 4~weeks. Faecal peanut-specific IgA and serum-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a levels were measured, and the intestinal microbiota was analysed. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with anti-CD25 antibodies for regulatory T cell (Treg) depletion to evaluate the efficacy of Tregs in preventing peanut allergy. After challenge, anaphylactic reactions, plasma histamine, Tregs, and splenocyte interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4, IL-5 and interferon-{$\gamma$} (IFN-{$\gamma$}) levels were evaluated. RESULTS: After 4~weeks of recombinant spore treatment, faecal IgA levels and serum IgG2a levels were increased, while serum IgG1 and IgE levels were reduced. Intestinal microbiota analysis revealed that CNAP spores increased the taxonomic abundance of Firmicutes at the phylum level and Clostridia at the class level. After challenge, the administration of NAP or CNAP spores to mice was found to ameliorate anaphylactic reactions and decrease plasma histamine levels. Administration of NAP or CNAP spores also enhanced IL-10 and IFN-{$\gamma$} secretion, and suppressed IL-4 and IL-5 secretion. The protective effect of CNAP spores was more pronounced than that of NAP spores; this therapeutic effect was lost after Treg depletion. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Recombinant NAP spores successfully suppressed Th2 inflammation via the up-regulation of Tregs; this may serve as a novel therapeutic approach for treating food allergies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intramuscular immunisation with a vaccine composed of three recombinant Helicobacter pylori antigens-vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA), cytotoxin-associated antigen (CagA), and neutrophil-activating protein (NAP)-prevented infection in animal models and was well tolerated and highly immunogenic in healthy adults. We aimed to assess the efficacy of the vaccine in prevention of a H pylori infection after challenge with a CagA-positive strain (BCM 300) in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In this randomised phase 1/2, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre study, healthy non-pregnant adults aged 18-40 years who were confirmed negative for H pylori infection were randomly assigned (3:4) to three intramuscular doses of either placebo or vaccine at 0, 1, and 2 months. Randomisation was via a computer-generated list with study numbers ensuring the correct ratio within a block size of seven. Participants were consecutively assigned in a double-blind manner to existing study numbers of the study protocol. Investigators and participants were blinded to allocation throughout the study. One month after the third immunisation, participants underwent challenge with a CagA-positive H pylori strain, which, for safety reasons, was initially administered in a subset of participants. The primary efficacy outcome was the efficacy of the vaccine as measured by the proportion of participants infected with H pylori 12 weeks after the challenge. At the end of the study, participants infected with H pylori were treated for 14 days with combination therapy consisting of a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics twice daily. Safety and immunogenicity were monitored at pre-established visits. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00736476, and is completed. FINDINGS: 63 patients were randomly assigned, 27 to placebo and 36 to the vaccine. 34 participants (19 in the vaccinated group and 15 in the placebo group) underwent infectious challenge, all but one of whom experienced transient mild-to-moderate epigastric symptoms. 12 weeks after infectious challenge, six (32\%) of 19 people in the vaccinated group and six (40\%) of 15 people in the placebo group remained positive for H pylori. Eradication was successful in everyone who remained infected at 12 weeks. The geometric mean concentrations of antibodies specific to CagA (202 [95\% CI 69-588] vs 4{$\cdot$}73 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}41-16]; p=0{$\cdot$}001), VacA (1469 [838-2577] vs 73 [39-138]; p=0{$\cdot$}001), and NAP (208 [139-313] vs 8{$\cdot$}01 [5{$\cdot$}05-13]; p=0{$\cdot$}001) were significantly higher in the vaccine group than in the placebo group 12 weeks after infectious challenge. INTERPRETATION: Compared with placebo, the vaccine did not confer additional protection against H pylori infection after challenge with a CagA-positive strain, despite increased systemic humoral responses to key H pylori antigens. The finding of spontaneous clearance of H pylori infection in more than half the participants in the placebo group is remarkable and suggests important immune protection in the healthy adult population.

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Progress continues in our understanding of the role of Helicobacter pylori infection in gastroduodenal as well as extragastric disorders. This review gives an overview on selected areas of the H. pylori infection and their clinical implications. RECENT FINDINGS: Indications for therapy have been extended and now include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, iron deficiency anemia, and vitamin B12 deficiency. New data are presented on the role of H. pylori in neurodegenerative disorders and in the metabolic syndrome. H. pylori is associated with a (small) increase in the risk for colorectal adenoma and colon cancer. The biggest challenge is the selection of new therapies and treatment strategies because of the increasing failure of standard triple therapies. The best option in high clarithromycin resistance areas is bismuth-based quadruple therapy. Probiotic bacteria and yeasts reduce adverse effects of standard H. pylori eradication regimens. In gastric cancer prevention, screening programs based on the serological detection of preneoplastic conditions may prove useful. SUMMARY: New algorithms for preventing H. pylori-induced disease and eradicating the organism should be individualized.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The indication for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication has been extended to few extragastroduodenal diseases. Scientific rigor needs to be applied as the list of clinical manifestations potentially related to H. pylori has disproportionally grown to its scientific evidence. Some potential beneficial aspects of H. pylori in allergic diseases and in the context of obesity are critically addressed in this review. The main challenge, however, continues to be the prevention of gastric cancer by H. pylori eradication. Strategies for identification of individuals and populations at risk are reported as well. A final aspect is dedicated to novel treatment regimens for overcoming the increasing treatment failures with proton pump inhibitor-based triple standards. RECENT FINDINGS: H. pylori infection is associated with some extragastric diseases such as idiopathic thrombocytic purpura and iron deficiency anemia that benefit from eradication therapy. The inverse relation of H. pylori prevalence and the increase in allergies and obesity, as reported from epidemiological studies, has prompted research for elucidating potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Strategies for gastric cancer prevention include serological screening, which allow adopting eradication therapy in individuals at high risk. New treatments for H. pylori include sequential, bismuth-based quadruple and nonbismuth-based quadruple therapies. SUMMARY: The main clinical challenge remains prevention of H. pylori-related diseases by effective treatment and screening procedures.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Helicobacter pylori infection is among the most common human infections and the major risk factor for peptic disease and gastric cancer. Immunization with vaccines containing the H pylori vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA), cytotoxin-associated antigen (CagA), and neutrophil-activating protein (NAP), alone or in combination, have been shown to prevent experimental infection in animals. AIM: We sought to study the safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine consisting of recombinant VacA, CagA, and NAP given intramuscularly with aluminium hydroxide as an adjuvant to noninfected healthy subjects. METHODS: This controlled, single-blind Phase I study randomized 57 H pylori-negative volunteers into 7 study arms exploring 2 dosages (10 and 25 microg) of each antigen and 3 schedules (0, 1, 2 weeks; 0, 1, 2 months; and 0, 1, 4 months) versus alum controls. All participants were followed for 5 months. Thirty-six subjects received a booster vaccination 18-24 months after the completion of the primary vaccination. RESULTS: Local and systemic adverse reactions were mild and similar in placebo and vaccine recipients on the monthly schedules. All subjects responded to 1 or 2 of the antigens and 86\% of all vaccines mounted immunoglobulin G antibody responses to all 3 antigens. Vaccinees exhibited an antigen-specific cellular response. Vaccination 18-24 months later elicited anamnestic antibody and cellular responses. CONCLUSIONS: This intramuscular H pylori vaccine demonstrated satisfactory safety and immunogenicity, produced antigen-specific T-cell memory, and, therefore, warrants further clinical study.},

Most recently, the identification of an additional subset, known as Th17 cells, has further illustrated the complexity and diversity of effector CD4(+) T cells. Th17 responses have been closely associated with the cytokine interleukin (IL)-23 and, although originally pinpointed as having a deleterious role in autoimmune tissue pathology, the IL-23/Th17 axis has also been associated with protective immunity at mucosal surfaces. Recent progress has highlighted the heterogeneous nature of Th17 responses, has demonstrated diverse cellular sources for Th17-associated cytokines, and has begun to dissect the individual roles of these cytokines in different disease processes. Here, we will review the evidence linking the IL-23/Th17 axis to chronic intestinal inflammation and also will discuss its beneficial roles in intestinal protection and homeostasis.},

Like T(H)1 and T(H)2, T(H)17 cells almost certainly evolved to provide adaptive immunity tailored to specific classes of pathogens, such as extracellular bacteria. Aberrant T(H)17 responses have been implicated in a growing list of autoimmune disorders. T(H)17 development has been linked to IL-23, an IL-12 cytokine family member that shares with IL-12 a common subunit, IL-12p40 (ref. 8). The IL-23 and IL-12 receptors also share a subunit, IL-12Rbeta1, that pairs with unique, inducible components, IL-23R and IL-12Rbeta2, to confer receptor responsiveness. Here we identify transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) as a cytokine critical for commitment to T(H)17 development. TGF-beta acts to upregulate IL-23R expression, thereby conferring responsiveness to IL-23. Although dispensable for the development of IL-17-producing T cells in vitro and in vivo, IL-23 is required for host protection against a bacterial pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. The action of TGF-beta on naive T cells is antagonized by interferon-gamma and IL-4, thus providing a mechanism for divergence of the T(H)1, T(H)2 and T(H)17 lineages.},

Current stage technology allows the acquisition of profiles for a moderate number of genes (50 to a few thousand), and this number continues to grow. The use of appropriate normalization algorithms for qPCR-based data is therefore a highly important aspect of the data preprocessing pipeline. Results We present and evaluate two data-driven normalization methods that directly correct for technical variation and represent robust alternatives to standard housekeeping gene-based approaches. We evaluated the performance of these methods against a single gene housekeeping gene method and our results suggest that quantile normalization performs best. These methods are implemented in freely-available software as an R package qpcrNorm distributed through the Bioconductor project. Conclusion The utility of the approaches that we describe can be demonstrated most clearly in situations where standard housekeeping genes are regulated by some experimental condition. For large qPCR-based data sets, our approaches represent robust, data-driven strategies for normalization.},

The immune potentiating capacity of IL-12 and its mandatory requirement in host defense predispose it to rigorous regulation. The time, localization, and magnitude of IL-12 production during an immune response strongly influence the type, extent, and, ultimately, the fate of the response. Disturbance of this evolutionarily maintained "balance of power" frequently leads to immunologic disorders. This article reviews the intricate pathways that have been uncovered in which IL-12 production is modulated by numerous pathogens and immunological regulators.

We evaluate whether these alterations in intestinal microbiota composition produced by H. pylori infection and its posterior eradication with antibiotic treatment could be associated with glucose homeostasis in metabolically healthy subjects. METHODS: Forty adult patients infected with H. pylori and 20 control subjects were recruited. The infected subjects were evaluated before and two months after eradication treatment (omeprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin). The microbiota composition in fecal samples was determined by 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4) sequencing using Illumina Miseq. RESULTS: Patients (pre- and post-H. pylori eradication) showed a decreased bacterial richness and diversity with respect to controls. There was an improvement in glucose homeostasis in subjects two months after H. pylori eradication treatment. Changes in the amount of Rikenellaceae, Butyricimonas, E. biforme, B. fragilis, and Megamonas were inversely associated with changes in the glucose level or related parameters (Hb1ac) in H. pylori eradication subjects. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection and eradication with antibiotic treatment causes alteration of the human gut microbiome. The increase in SCFA-producing bacteria and glucose-removing bacteria, specifically members of Megamonas, Rikenellaceae and Butyricimonas, has been related with an improvement in glucose homeostasis after H. pylori eradication with antibiotic treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori has been shown to induce pronounced gastric inflammation in the absence of interleukin-10 (IL-10) by 6 weeks post inoculation. The ability of IL-10(-/-) mice to eradicate H. pylori has not been demonstrated, possibly due to early sacrifice. Therefore, the long-term effect of enhanced gastritis on H. pylori colonization was determined in IL-10(-/-) mice. METHODS: C57BL/6 and IL-10(-/-) mice were infected with H. pylori and assessed for the degree of gastritis, bacterial load, and in vitro T-cell recall response at 4 and 16 weeks of infection. RESULTS: Infection of IL-10(-/-) mice resulted in significantly more severe gastritis than wild-type control mice and eradication of H. pylori by 4 weeks post inoculation. By 16 weeks, the level of gastritis in IL-10(-/-) was reduced to the levels observed in wild-type mice. Splenocytes from IL-10(-/-) mice were prone to produce significantly greater amounts of IFN-gamma than wild-type mice when stimulated with bacterial antigens. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the host is capable of spontaneously eradicating H. pylori from the gastric mucosa when inflammation is elevated beyond the chronic inflammation induced in wild-type mice, and that the gastritis dissipates following bacterial eradication. Additionally, these data provide support for a model of gastrointestinal immunity in which naturally occurring IL-10-producing regulatory T cells modulate the host response to gastrointestinal bacteria.},

  abstract = {The recently discovered cytokine interleukin (IL)-12 is a heterodimeric protein of two disulfide-bonded subunits of 35 and 40 kDa. IL-12 has multiple effects on T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. In particular it appears to be a major factor for the development of cellular immunity. So far activity of the single subunits alone has not been described, however their expression is regulated independently. In this report we demonstrate for the first time that the mouse IL-12 subunit p40 (IL-12p40) specifically antagonizes the effects of the IL-12 heterodimer in different assay systems. The proliferation of mouse splenocytes activated by phorbol ester and IL-12 was inhibited by IL-12p40, whereas the proliferation induced by phorbol ester and IL-2 was not affected. Furthermore, the synthesis of interferon (IFN)-gamma by mouse splenocytes activated with IL-2 and IL-12 was suppressed by IL-12p40. Purified mouse splenic CD4+ T cells produced IFN-gamma upon activation with plate-bound anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody which was enhanced more than tenfold in the presence of IL-12. In this system IL-12p40 inhibited only the enhancement caused by IL-12 but not IFN-gamma synthesis of CD4+ T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 alone. Moreover, IL-12p40 inhibited the effects of IL-12 on differentiated T helper type 1 (Th1) cells. IFN-gamma production by Th1 cells induced in a T cell receptor-independent way by macrophages and IL-2 or macrophages and IL-12 was greatly reduced by IL-12p40 providing evidence for the endogenous synthesis of IL-12 in the Th1 cell, macrophage and IL-2 co-cultures. The specificity of inhibition was clearly demonstrated in the homotypic aggregation assay of Th1 cells. Incubation of Th1 cells with either IL-2 and IL-12 or IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor induces LFA-1/ICAM-1-dependent aggregation. Only IL-2 + IL-12 but not IL-2 + tumor necrosis factor-induced aggregation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by IL-12p40. Thus, the IL-12 subunit p40 appears to be a specific inhibitor for the IL-12 heterodimer.},

This was studied in antrum and corpus biopsies collected from 11 H. pylori-infected patients with duodenal ulcers, 11 asymptomatic H. pylori carriers, and 13 noninfected, healthy controls. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the biopsies and assayed for frequencies of total and H. pylori-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) by means of the enzyme-linked immunospot technique. The H. pylori-infected subjects had remarkably higher frequencies of total immunoglobulin A (IgA)- and IgM-secreting cells than the noninfected subjects, while the frequencies of IgG-secreting cells were virtually the same in the different groups. In addition, most of the infected subjects had IgA ASCs reacting with H. pylori membrane proteins, flagellin, and urease, while none of the noninfected subjects had any detectable H. pylori-reactive ASCs. Furthermore, half of the infected subjects also had ASCs reacting with a Helicobacter-specific 26-kDa protein, while only a few of them had ASCs reacting with neutrophil-activating protein, the neuraminyllactose-binding hemagglutinin HpaA, or lipopolysaccharides purified from different H. pylori strains. The frequencies of H. pylori-specific ASCs in the antrum and corpus were almost identical, and no differences in either antigen specificity or magnitude of the B-cell response in the stomach could be detected between the ulcer patients and the asymptomatic H. pylori carriers. This study demonstrates that H. pylori infection induces strong antibody responses in the human gastric mucosa, both in asymptomatic carriers and in duodenal ulcer patients. However, the outcome of infection could not be explained by differences in the local B-cell response to any of the antigens used in this study.},

DISCUSSION: The present review discusses the current knowledge on genetic susceptibility, especially of the IL-12/IL-23 pathway, the pathophysiologic role of the involved cytokines (e.g. IL-13, IL-23, TGF{$\beta$}1) and immune cells (e.g. T cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts) in UC followed by an overview on actual therapeutic considerations. These future therapies will target selectively the involved cell types by blocking their activation and its downstream signalling, by inhibiting their migration to the inflamed site and by anti-cytokine strategies. This may avoid-when initiated in time-the perpetuation of the inflammatory mechanisms thus preventing fibrosis. With respect to animal models that have guided the most productive efforts for understanding human inflammatory bowel disease, these will be shortly discussed in the respective context.},

Although the transcription factor T-bet is required for IFN-gamma expression in CD4+ T cells, it is reportedly dispensable in CD8+ T cells, where the transcription factor Eomesodermin is thought to be sufficient. The diverse functions of IFN-gamma are mediated through the IFN-gammaR and STAT1. In CD4+ T cells, STAT1 appears to be critical for the activation of T-bet and IFN-gamma, suggesting an IFN-gamma-dependent positive feedback loop. However, STAT1 can also be activated by other cytokines, including IL-27. In the present study we show that, in contrast to in vitro conditions and the prevailing paradigm, T-bet is critical for the in vivo IFN-gamma production by CD8+ T cells upon infection of mice with diverse pathogens. Whereas IFN-gammaR signals are dispensable for the T-bet-dependent IFN-gamma production, direct IL-27Ralpha signals are critical.},

Recent studies have identified important roles for commensal microbiota and Ahr ligands in stabilizing Th17 gene expression in vivo, linking environmental cues to CD4 T cell polarization. Epigenetic changes that occur during the transition from na\"ive to effector Th17 cells increase the accessibility of il17a, il17f, and il22 loci to transcription factors. In addition, Th17 cells maintain the potential for expressing T-bet, Foxp3, or GATA-binding protein-3, explaining their plastic nature under various cytokine microenvironments. Although CD4 T cells are major sources of IL-17 and IL-22, innate cell populations, including {$\gamma\delta$} T cells, NK cells, and lymphoid tissue-inducer cells, are early sources of these cytokines during IL-23-driven responses. Epithelial cells and fibroblasts are important cellular targets for IL-17 in vivo; however, recent data suggest that macrophages and B cells are also stimulated directly by IL-17. Thus, Th17 cells interact with multiple populations to facilitate protection against intracellular and extracellular pathogens.},

In this study, LPS increased Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin A-specific T cells in the gut through induction of IL-12 family members. Mice deficient in IL-12 (p35(-/-)) favored T(h)17 differentiation in lamina propria, whereas mice lacking both IL-12 and IL-23 (p40(-/-)) produced significantly fewer T(h)17 cells. However, serum analysis revealed that IL-27p28 was much higher and sustained following LPS injection than other IL-12 family cytokines. Strikingly, WSX-1 (IL-27R{$\alpha$}) deficiency resulted in log-fold increases in lamina propria T(h)17 cells without affecting T(h)1 numbers. These results may be explained by increased expression of {$\alpha$}4{$\beta$}7 on WSX-1-deficient T cells after immunization. WSX-1-deficient regulatory T cells (Tregs) were also perturbed, producing more IL-17 and less IL-10 than wild-type Tregs.

Unexpectedly, here we found that stimulation of myelin-reactive T cells with TGF-beta plus IL-6 completely abrogated their pathogenic function despite upregulation of IL-17 production. Cells stimulated with TGF-beta plus IL-6 were present in the spleen as well as the central nervous system, but they failed to upregulate the proinflammatory chemokines crucial for central nervous system inflammation. In addition, these cells produced IL-10, which has potent anti-inflammatory activities. In contrast, stimulation with IL-23 promoted expression of IL-17 and proinflammatory chemokines but not IL-10. Hence, TGF-beta and IL-6 'drive' initial lineage commitment but also 'restrain' the pathogenic potential of T(H)-17 cells. Our findings suggest that full acquisition of pathogenic function by effector T(H)-17 cells is mediated by IL-23 rather than by TGF-beta and IL-6.},

Epidemiologic studies suggest that functional allelic variations in the MUC1 gene may play a role in human susceptibility to Helicobacter pylori-associated pathologies, including gastric adenocarcinoma. We have evaluated the impact of Muc1 expression on the colonization and pathogenesis of gastric Helicobacter infections. METHODS: Wild-type and Muc1-deficient mice were infected with H pylori and colonization and gastritis levels determined. Primary gastric cells were used to examine the impact of Muc1 expression on bacterial adherence. RESULTS: Mice lacking Muc1 were colonized by 5-fold more H pylori within 1 day of infection, and this difference was maintained for at least 2 months postinfection. Mice heterozygous for the null Muc1 allele developed intermediate bacterial colonization. Although wild-type mice developed only a mild gastritis when infected for 2 months with H pylori, Muc1(-/-) mice developed an atrophic gastritis marked by loss of parietal cells. We demonstrate H pylori adhesion to purified MUC1 and significantly increased adhesion to cultured murine Muc1 null gastric epithelial cells, suggesting that Muc1 acts as a decoy limiting binding to the cell surface. CONCLUSIONS: Muc1 provides a protective barrier, which limits both acute and chronic colonization by H pylori, as well as playing a major role in limiting the inflammation induced by Helicobacter infection. We propose that Muc1 restricts access of H pylori to the epithelial surface, hence reducing exposure of the host to proinflammatory bacterial products.},

Yet, despite a strong structural relationship that includes a shared p40 subunit, this does not translate into functional similarity. In fact, the opposite is true, in that these two cytokines appear to have profoundly different roles in regulating host immune responses. It is now clear that IL-23 has key roles in autoimmune destruction in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, collagen-induced arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. IL-23 drives the development of autoreactive IL-17-producing T cells and promotes chronic inflammation dominated by IL-17, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor as well as neutrophils and monocytes. It is unlikely that IL-23 and its downstream effects evolved just to cause autoimmunity, but its real benefit to the host and the lineage relationship between IL-17-producing cells and T helper 1 cells remain unclear. By comparing the pathophysiological function of IL-12 and IL-23 in the context of host defense and autoimmune inflammation, we are beginning to understand the novel IL-23-IL-17 immune pathway.},

Triple treatment with a proton-pump inhibitor or bismuth salt plus two antibiotics is now commonplace in all patients diagnosed. As antibiotic resistance reduces treatment efficacy, it is time to consider routine susceptibility testing to guide individual patient treatment and surveillance of antibiotic resistance. There are no published nationally agreed standards for disc diffusion testing of H. pylori. After reviewing the literature, we recommend the following method for disc diffusion tests. A suspension of cultures {$<$} or = 4 days old equivalent to McFarland Standard no. 4 (10(8) cfu/mL) should be used on Mueller-Hinton or Columbia agar base with 5-10\% blood, using a metronidazole disc strength of 5 Ig and a clarithromycin disc strength of 2 microg. Anaerobic pre-incubation of plates is unnecessary. A H. pylori control susceptible to metronidazole (e.g. NCTC 12822) should be used. Zone sizes with the Mueller-Hinton agar base for metronidazole testing are {$<$}16 mm resistant, 16-21 mm intermediate and {$>$}21 mm susceptible. We suggest that isolates in the intermediate zone should be re-tested by Etest. Zone sizes with the Columbia agar base for metronidazole testing are {$<$}10 mm resistant and {$>$} or = 10 mm susceptible. Co-infection with two strains, which may be a mixture of isolates susceptible and resistant to metronidazole leading to conflicting susceptibility results, occurs in 5-10\% of patients.

Characterization of glycopeptides using both CID and ETD is summarized in this unit. While CID provides information related to the composition of glycan moieties attached to a peptide backbone, ETD permits de novo sequencing of peptides. Radical anion transfer of electrons to the peptide backbone in ETD induces cleavage of the N-C{$\alpha$} bond. The glycan moiety is retained on the peptide backbone, largely unaffected by the ETD process, thus allowing the identification of the amino acid sequence of a glycopeptide and its glycosylation site. This unit discusses the use of both CID and ETD for better characterization of glycopeptides.},

Culture was carried out on gastric biopsy samples obtained from 516 patients at entry and had a sensitivity of 99\% when the [13C]urea breath test was used as a reference. Susceptibility testing was performed for clarithromycin and metronidazole on 485 strains by an agar dilution method and the epsilometer test (Etest) and for amoxicillin by an agar dilution method only. Resistance to clarithromycin ({$>$}1 {$\mu$}g/ml) was found in 3\% of the H. pylori strains, with a perfect correlation between Etest and agar dilution methods. Resistance to metronidazole ({$>$}8 {$\mu$}l/ml) was found in 27\% of the strains by agar dilution, but there were important discrepancies between it and the Etest method. No resistance to amoxicillin was found. The logarithms of the MICs of the three antibiotics against susceptible strains had a distribution close to normal. The impact of resistance was tested in the four arms of the trial. There were not enough clarithromycin-resistant strains to evaluate the impact of resistance on the cure rate of clarithromycin-based regimens. For metronidazole-resistant strains, the impact noted in the clarithromycin-metronidazole arm was partially overcome when omeprazole was added (76\% eradication for resistant strains versus 95\% for susceptible strains). Secondary resistance to clarithromycin occurred in strains from 12 of 105 patients (11.4\%) after the failure of a clarithromycin-based regimen to effect eradication. The detection of point mutations in clarithromycin-resistant strains was performed by a combination of PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Mutations (A2142G and 2143G) were found in all strains tested except one. This study stresses the importance of performing susceptibility tests in clinical trials in order to explain the results of different treatments.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Resistance to antibiotics is the major cause of treatment failure of Helicobacter pylori infection. A study was conducted to assess prospectively the antibacterial resistance rates of H pylori in Europe and to study the link between outpatient antibiotic use and resistance levels in different countries. DESIGN: Primary antibiotic resistance rates of H pylori were determined from April 2008 to June 2009 in 18 European countries. Data on yearly and cumulative use over several years of systemic antibacterial agents in ambulatory care for the period 2001-8 were expressed in Defined Daily Doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day. The fit of models and the degree of ecological association between antibiotic use and resistance data were assessed using generalised linear mixed models. RESULTS: Of 2204 patients included, H pylori resistance rates for adults were 17.5\% for clarithromycin, 14.1\% for levofloxacin and 34.9\% for metronidazole, and were significantly higher for clarithromycin and levofloxacin in Western/Central and Southern Europe ({$>$}20\%) than in Northern European countries ({$<$}10\%). Model fit improved for each additional year of antibiotic use accumulated, but the best fit was obtained for 2005. A significant association was found between outpatient quinolone use and the proportion of levofloxacin resistance (p=0.0013) and between the use of long-acting macrolides only and clarithromycin resistance (p=0.036). CONCLUSION: In many countries the high rate of clarithromycin resistance no longer allows its empirical use in standard anti-H pylori regimens. The knowledge of outpatient antibiotic consumption may provide a simple tool to predict the susceptibility of H pylori to quinolones and to macrolides and to adapt the treatment strategies.},

Despite this, it remains unclear how cells discriminate unassembled proteins en route to the native state from misfolded ones that need to be degraded. Here we show how chaperones can regulate and control assembly of heterodimeric proteins, using interleukin 23 (IL-23) as a model. We find that the IL-23 {$\alpha$}-subunit remains partially unstructured until assembly with its {$\beta$}-subunit occurs and identify a major site of incomplete folding. Incomplete folding is recognized by different chaperones along the secretory pathway, realizing reliable assembly control by sequential checkpoints. Structural optimization of the chaperone recognition site allows~it to bypass quality control checkpoints and provides a secretion-competent IL-23{$\alpha$} subunit, which can still form functional heterodimeric IL-23. Thus, locally-restricted incomplete folding within single-domain proteins can be used to regulate and control their assembly.},

The basic properties of VI are presented and discussed. We focus on two kinds of properties: (1) those that help one build intuition about the new criterion (in particular, it is shown the VI is a true metric on the space of clusterings), and (2) those that pertain to the comparability of VI values over different experimental conditions. As the latter properties have rarely been discussed explicitly before, other existing comparison criteria are also examined in their light. Finally we present the VI from an axiomatic point of view, showing that it is the only ``sensible'' criterion for comparing partitions that is both aligned to the lattice and convexely additive. As a consequence, we prove an impossibility result for comparing partitions: there is no criterion for comparing partitions that simultaneously satisfies the above two desirable properties and is bounded.},

Understanding long term effects resulting from the cure of this infection is needed to design cancer prevention strategies. METHODS A cohort of 795 adults with preneoplastic gastric lesions was randomised to receive anti-H pylori treatment and/or antioxidants. At the end of six years of intervention, those who did not receive anti-H pylori treatment were offered it. Gastric biopsies were obtained at baseline, and at 3, 6, and 12 years. A histopathology score was utilised to document changes in gastric lesions. Non-linear mixed models were used to estimate the cumulative effect of H pylori clearance on histopathology scores adjusted for follow up time, interventions, and confounders. RESULTS Ninety seven per cent of subjects were H pylori positive at baseline, and 53\% were positive at 12 years. Subjects accumulated 1703 person years free of infection. A multivariate model showed a significant regression in histopathology score as a function of the square of H pylori negative time. Subjects who were H pylori negative had 14.8\% more regression and 13.7\% less progression than patients who were positive at 12 years (p = 0.001). The rate of healing of gastric lesions occurred more rapidly as years free of infection accumulated, and was more pronounced in less advanced lesions. CONCLUSIONS Preneoplastic gastric lesions regress at a rate equal to the square of time in patients rendered free of H pylori infection. Our findings suggest that patients with preneoplastic gastric lesions should be treated and cured of their H pylori infection.},

Then, they received three doses of 1-2 x 10(10) viable organisms of either the vaccine strain S. typhi Ty21a (pDB1) expressing subunits A and B of recombinant Helicobacter pylori urease (n = 9), or placebo strain S. typhi Ty21a (n = 4). Four volunteers were preimmunized and boosted with the vaccine strain S. typhi Ty21a (pDB1). No serious adverse effects were observed in any of the volunteers. Whereas none of the volunteers primed and boosted with the vaccine strain responded to the recombinant antigen, five of the nine volunteers preimmunized with the carrier strain showed cellular immune responses to H. pylori urease (56\%). This supports the results of a previous study in non-preimmunized volunteers where 56\% (five of nine) of the volunteers showed a cellular immune response to urease after immunisation with S. typhi Ty21a (pDB1).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Adequate normalization minimizes the effects of systematic technical variations and is a prerequisite for getting meaningful biological changes. However, there is inconsistency about miRNA normalization performances and recommendations. Thus, we investigated the impact of seven different normalization methods (reference gene index, global geometric mean, quantile, invariant selection, loess, loessM, and generalized procrustes analysis) on intra- and inter-platform performance of two distinct and commonly used miRNA profiling platforms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We included data from miRNA profiling analyses derived from a hybridization-based platform (Agilent Technologies) and an RT-qPCR platform (Applied Biosystems). Furthermore, we validated a subset of miRNAs by individual RT-qPCR assays. Our analyses incorporated data from the effect of differentiation and tumor necrosis factor alpha treatment on primary human skeletal muscle cells and a murine skeletal muscle cell line. Distinct normalization methods differed in their impact on (i) standard deviations, (ii) the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, (iii) the similarity of differential expression. Loess, loessM, and quantile analysis were most effective in minimizing standard deviations on the Agilent and TLDA platform. Moreover, loess, loessM, invariant selection and generalized procrustes analysis increased the area under the ROC curve, a measure for the statistical performance of a test. The Jaccard index revealed that inter-platform concordance of differential expression tended to be increased by loess, loessM, quantile, and GPA normalization of AGL and TLDA data as well as RGI normalization of TLDA data. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE We recommend the application of loess, or loessM, and GPA normalization for miRNA Agilent arrays and qPCR cards as these normalization approaches showed to (i) effectively reduce standard deviations, (ii) increase sensitivity and accuracy of differential miRNA expression detection as well as (iii) increase inter-platform concordance. Results showed the successful adoption of loessM and generalized procrustes analysis to one-color miRNA profiling experiments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection that is usually acquired in childhood and lasts for lifetime is mostly asymptomatic but associated with severe gastrointestinal disease including cancer. During chronic infection, the gastric mucosa is histologically changing. This forces H. pylori to permanent adaptation in its gastric habitat by expression of different proteins which might be reflected in distinctive antibody patterns. METHODS: To characterize dynamics of the immune response to H. pylori we analysed 1797 sera of a cross-sectional study representative for the German population (age range 1-82 years) with multiplex serology, a fluorescent bead-based antibody binding assay that allows simultaneous and quantitative detection of antibodies. Fifteen recombinant, affinity-purified H. pylori proteins (UreA, GroEL, Catalase, NapA, CagA, CagM, Cag{$\delta$}, HP0231, VacA, HpaA, Cad, HyuA, Omp, HcpC and HP0305) were used as antigens. RESULTS: H. pylori seroprevalence (positivity for at least three antigens) was 48\% and increased with age from 12\% in children {$<$}15~years to 69\% in females and 90\% in males {$>$}65~years. Prevalences were highest ({$>$}83\%) for Omp, VacA and GroEL. For 11 proteins, seroprevalence was higher in males than females (P\,{$<$}\,0.05) from age 55 onwards. For all antigens, the median prevalence increase per age decade was stronger in males (8.4\%, range 3.8-12.9\%) than females (6.1\%, range 3.4-10.8\%). However, among seropositives the median number of antigens recognized increased from children {$<$}15~years to individuals {$>$}65~years stronger in females (P\,=\,0.02). Antibody reactivities to GroEL, HyuA, CagM, Catalase, NapA and UreA also increased stronger in females (average 1.7-fold/decade, SD 0.5) than in males (1.5-fold/decade, SD 0.4). CONCLUSION: H. pylori antibody response accumulates qualitatively and quantitatively with age. This may reflect a lifelong stimulation of the immune response by chronically active infection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Oral immunization with Helicobacter pylori urease can cure Helicobacter infection in animals. As a step toward therapeutic immunization in humans, the safety and immunogenicity of oral immunization with recombinant H. pylori urease were tested in H. pylori-infected adults. METHODS: Twenty-six H. pylori-infected volunteers were randomized in a double-blind study to four weekly oral doses of 180, 60, or 20 mg of urease with 5 microg heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (LT), LT alone, or placebo. Side effects and immune responses were evaluated weekly after immunization, and gastric biopsy specimens were obtained after 1 month and 6 months for histology and quantitative cultures. RESULTS: Diarrhea was noted in 16 of 24 (66\%) of the volunteers who completed the study. Antiurease serum immunoglobulin A titers increased 1. 58-fold +/- 0.37-fold and 3.66-fold +/- 1.5-fold (mean +/- SEM) after immunization with 60 and 180 mg urease, respectively, whereas no change occurred in the placebo +/- LT groups (P = 0.005). Circulating antiurease immunoglobulin A-producing cells increased in volunteers exposed to urease compared with placebo (38.9 +/- 13. 6/10(6) vs. 5.4 +/- 3.1; P = 0.018). Eradication of H. pylori infection was not observed, but urease immunization induced a significant decrease in gastric H. pylori density. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori urease with LT is well tolerated and immunogenic in H. pylori-infected individuals. An improved vaccine formulation may induce curative immunity.},

Synoviocytes isolated from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients were stimulated with recombinant SAA and IL-23 expression was investigated using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The involvement of mitogen-activated protein kineases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor (NF)-{$\kappa$}B in SAA-induced interleukin (IL)-23 p19 expression was investigated using pharmacological inhibitors. In RA synoviocytes, SAA induced the expression of IL-23 p19 and p40 mRNA expression. The SAA-stimulated expression of p19 was rapid ({$<$} 3 h), and insensitive to polymyxin B treatment. This SAA-stimulated expression of IL-23 p19 was inhibited completely by inhibitors of NF-{$\kappa$}B, p38MAPK and dexamethasone. Interestingly, the SAA-induced IL-23, p19 and p40 production was accompanied by enhanced expression of IL-1{$\beta$}, but not transforming growth factor-{$\beta$}. These results indicate that SAA is a significant inducer of IL-23 and IL-1{$\beta$} in RA synoviocytes and potentially activates the IL-23/IL-17 pathway in the RA synovium.

Based on the fact that the serum pepsinogen levels provide a precise measure of the extent of chronic atrophic gastritis, we have devised a mass screening method involving serum pepsinogen measurement to identify subjects at high risk of gastric cancer. In 1991, we screened 4,647 workers (male: 4,113, female: 534, mean age: 49.0 years) at a Japanese company using this method. Out of 875 subjects (18.8\%) with a serum pepsinogen I level of less than 50 micrograms/liter and a pepsinogen I/II ratio of less than 3.0, 676 subjects (14.5\%) were selected for further investigation by endoscopy. This led to the detection of four subjects (0.086\%) with gastric cancer (three in an early stage) and four subjects with adenoma. The cancer detection rate of this new screening method was comparable, and in some respects superior, to that of the traditional barium X-ray screening. Since the incidence of test-positive subjects was as low as 10\% amongst subjects aged less than 40, this screening method appears to be especially useful for screening of younger generations. The new method is less expensive than the traditional barium X-ray and subjects experience little discomfort. Further, many serum samples can be quickly measured simultaneously. The results of this study have indicated that serum pepsinogen screening provides a valuable method for detecting gastric cancers.},

Despite generating an inflammatory response, the immune system usually fails to clear the infection. Since dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in shaping the immune response, we investigated the effects of H. pylori on DC function. We have demonstrated that H. pylori increased the expression of activation markers on DCs while upregulating the inhibitory B7 family molecule, PD-L1. Functionally, H. pylori-treated DCs resulted in the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-23 but not of alpha interferon (IFN-alpha). While very little or no IL-12 was produced to H. pylori alone, simultaneous ligation of CD40 on DCs induced IL-12 release. We also demonstrated that DCs treated with H. pylori-induced IFN-gamma production by allogeneic naive T cells. However, stimulation of DCs with H. pylori for an extended period of time impaired their ability to produce cytokines after CD40 ligation and limited their ability to promote IFN-gamma release, suggesting that the DCs had become exhausted by the prolonged stimulation. The effect of chronic infection with H. pylori on DC function was further investigated by focusing on DC development. Demonstrating that monocytes differentiated into DCs in the presence of H. pylori exhibited an exhausted phenotype with an impaired ability to produce IL-12 and a downregulation of CD1a. Our results raise the possibility that in chronic H. pylori infection DCs become exhausted after prolonged antigen exposure leading to suboptimal Th1 development. This effect may contribute to persistence of H. pylori infection.},

  abstract = {The external surfaces of the body, such as the skin and the gastrointestinal mucosal membrane, are an important line of defence preventing the invasion of microorganisms and their products. Mucosal immune cells, especially intraepithelial lymphocytes, are involved in maintaining the integrity of these epithelial barriers. They contribute towards the tolerance to commensal organisms, which occupy these same sites, and to the immune responses against harmful organisms and their products. The composition of the microbiota is influenced by immune cells as well as external environmental factors, especially the use of antibiotics and diet. There is an increasing appreciation that the microbiota affects systemic immune responses in addition to local immunity. Failure to control the occupancy by microorganisms may result in the disruption of the delicate homeostasis between beneficial and harmful microorganisms and contribute to inflammatory pathologies. This review will discuss some of our current understanding of the impact of immune cells and diet on the microbiota.},

IgG antibodies were observed to recognize the LPSs of representative H. pylori serotypes O:1, O:2 and O:5, and more significantly, the core region of H. pylori. This study showed that a monovalent H. pylori LPS conjugate can elicit antibodies that recognize other serotype-specific H. pylori LPSs and specifically the structurally conserved LPS inner-regions.},

BabA-mediated attachment to the gastric mucosa promotes chronic inflammation and gastric pathology, which from the bacterial perspective carries both risks and benefits. We recently described modulation in expression of BabA and related outer membrane proteins that occurs during colonization of experimental animals. Here we put these findings into a broader context, and speculate on their implications for the host-pathogen relationship.},

For example, multiple recent dating estimates are based on a universal inter-species molecular clock rate, but that rate was calibrated using estimates of geological dates that are no longer accepted. We therefore estimated the short-term rates of mutation and recombination in Helicobacter pylori by sequencing an average of 39,300 bp in 78 gene fragments from 97 isolates. These isolates included 34 pairs of sequential samples, which were sampled at intervals of 0.25 to 10.2 years. They also included single isolates from 29 individuals (average age: 45 years) from 10 families. The accumulation of sequence diversity increased with time of separation in a clock-like manner in the sequential isolates. We used Approximate Bayesian Computation to estimate the rates of mutation, recombination, mean length of recombination tracts, and average diversity in those tracts. The estimates indicate that the short-term mutation rate is 1.4 x 10(-6) (serial isolates) to 4.5 x 10(-6) (family isolates) per nucleotide per year and that three times as many substitutions are introduced by recombination as by mutation. The long-term mutation rate over millennia is 5-17-fold lower, partly due to the removal of non-synonymous mutations due to purifying selection. Comparisons with the recent literature show that short-term mutation rates vary dramatically in different bacterial species and can span a range of several orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori infection can cause gastritis, peptic ulcer and can lead to gastric cancer. Lengthy antibiotic therapy does not protect the host against reinfection. H. pylori evolved to evade the recognition of the immune response by modifying several of its components whose orthologous proteins from other bacteria activate the innate immune response. Flagella are essential for the H. pylori effective colonization of human duodenum and stomach. TLR5, a member of the Toll-like receptor family, recognizes flagellin of most bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, but does not recognize the flagellin FlaA of H. pylori. We restored the ability of FlaA for the recognition by TLR5 by engineering a chimeric flagellin, in which both terminal segments of H. pylori flagellin were replaced by the corresponding segments from TLR5-activating E. coli flagellin. Recombinant chimeric flagellin folded correctly and was able to activate TLR5. Significantly increased serum IgG and IgA antibody responses were determined in mice vaccinated with chimeric flagellin in comparison to mice vaccinated with a control protein (FlaA) or negative control. Antibody titers remained high even 8 months after the last immunization. Antibodies were able to bind native flagellin from H. pylori lysate. Vaccination with chimeric flagellin provided mice with significant protection against H. pylori. The approach of chimeric flagellin can therefore generate effective immunogens that enable activation of innate and adaptive immune response and can be used to construct efficient vaccines against H. pylori or other flagellated bacteria that evade TLR5 recognition.},

Because no effective vaccine has yet been established, we designed a new biomolecule as a vaccination antigen capable of preventing the infection of H. pylori. The designed biomolecule involves a 138 stretch (aa 201-aa 338 of beta-subunit of H. pylori urease), which is the functionally important region for urease activity. The region was expressed as a recombinant protein, called UREB138. The therapeutic vaccination was performed using UREB138 in mice persistently infected with H. pylori. The subcutaneous administration of UREB138 remarkably reduced the number of bacteria in the mice stomach compared with the control. Immunization with UREB138 enhanced the urease-specific IgA and IgG1 in the serum. Immunohistochemical staining for IgA in gastric mucosa showed that the number of mice positively stained with IgA was significantly higher in UREB138-immunized mice than in control mice. Furthermore, the expression of interferon-gamma mRNA in the gastric tissues with eradicated bacteria was higher than in the non-eradicated group. The combination of Th1- and Th2-mediated immunity plays a role in reducing the colonization of bacterial numbers of H. pylori.},

The dose-response relationship in preventing gastric mucosal damage and in inhibiting gastric acid and pepsin secretion was investigated. In the same animals, a simultaneous evaluation of barrier and luminal mucus was also performed. Both compounds were markedly active in preventing the macroscopic damage of the gastric mucosa and, at higher doses, in inhibiting gastric acid secretion. FCE 20700 was approximately 100-150 times less potent than DMPGE2. Mucosal protection appeared to be exerted by the two prostaglandins independently of any action on mucus. Furthermore, as the antisecretory doses were approached, a decline in protective activity became evident, suggesting that the dosage of prostaglandins is critical, making it possible to orient their activity either towards mucosal protection or towards acid inhibition.},

Due to the decreasing efficacy of anti-H. pylori antibiotic therapy in clinical practice, there is renewed interest in the development of anti-H. pylori vaccines. In this study an in silico-based approach was utilized to develop a multi-epitope DNA-prime/peptide-boost immunization strategy using informatics tools. The efficacy of this construct was then assessed as a therapeutic vaccine in a mouse model of gastric cancer induced by chronic H. pylori infection. The multi-epitope vaccine administered intranasally induced a broad immune response as determined by interferon-gamma production in ELISpot assays. This was associated with a significant reduction in H. pylori colonization compared with mice immunized with the same vaccine intramuscularly, given an empty plasmid, or given a whole H. pylori lysate intranasally as the immunogen. Total scores of gastric histological changes were not significantly different among the 4 experimental groups. These results suggest that further development of an epitope-based mucosal vaccine may be beneficial in eradicating H. pylori and reducing the burden of the associated gastric diseases in humans.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Through its effects on gastric secretion, we hypothesized that Helicobacter pylori infection may influence oral immunization. Accordingly, we examined the association between H. pylori infection, serum pepsinogen (PG) (measures for H. pylori gastritis) and vibriocidal antibody (a correlate of protection) seroconversion following oral immunization with CVD 103-HgR live cholera vaccine among children of different ages. METHODS: Sera from 422 Chilean children who were vaccinated with a single dose of CVD 103-HgR were tested by ELISA for serum IgG antibodies to H. pylori, PG I and PG II levels and antibodies to Shigella flexneri 2a lipopolysaccharide and hepatitis A virus (as markers of low socioeconomic status and exposure to enteric pathogens). RESULTS: The likelihood of vibriocidal antibody seroconversion following vaccination with CVD 103-HgR was significantly decreased in H. pylori-seropositive children age 6 months to 4 years with PG II{$>$}8 \textmu g/L (adjusted OR 0.14 (95\% CI 0.03-0.61; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.009), and also in H. pylori seropositives with lower PG II level (adjusted OR 0.34, 95\% CI 0.14-0.83; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.017), compared to H. pylori-seronegatives. H. pylori-seropositive children aged 5-9 years with serum PG I{$>$}30 \textmu g/L (indicating more severe gastritis) had higher odds of vibriocidal seroconversion than those with lower PG I levels (adjusted OR 4.41, 95\%CI 1.26-15.38; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.02). There was no significant association between exposures to S. flexneri 2a or hepatitis A virus and vibriocidal seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS: As H. pylori gastritis progresses with increasing pediatric age in developing country venues, changes in gastric secretion ensue that we believe explain the observed differences in age-related immune responses to immunization with live oral cholera vaccine. The effect of H. pylori and changes of gastric acid secretion on the immunogenicity of various oral vaccines should be studied in different developing, transitional and industrialized country settings.},

  abstract = {A common design principle of heteromeric signaling proteins is the use of shared subunits. This allows encoding of complex messages while maintaining evolutionary flexibility. How cells regulate and control assembly of such composite signaling proteins remains an important open question. An example of particular complexity and biological relevance is the interleukin 12 (IL-12) family. Four functionally distinct {$\alpha\beta$} heterodimers are assembled from only five subunits to regulate immune cell function and development. In addition, some subunits act as independent signaling molecules. Here we unveil key molecular mechanisms governing IL-27 biogenesis, an IL-12 family member that limits infections and autoimmunity. In mice, the IL-27{$\alpha$} subunit is secreted as a cytokine, whereas in humans only heterodimeric IL-27 is present. Surprisingly, we find that differences in a single amino acid determine if IL-27{$\alpha$} can be secreted autonomously, acting as a signaling molecule, or if it depends on heterodimerization for secretion. By combining computer simulations with biochemical experiments, we dissect the underlying structural determinants: a protein folding switch coupled to disulfide bond formation regulates chaperone-mediated retention versus secretion. Using these insights, we rationally change folding and assembly control for this protein. This provides the basis for a more human-like IL-27 system in mice and establishes a secretion-competent human IL-27{$\alpha$} that signals on its own and can regulate immune cell function. Taken together, our data reveal a close link between protein folding and immunoregulation. Insights into the underlying mechanisms can be used to engineer immune modulators.},

In addition, we found that Th17 cells had high expression of Tcf7, a direct target of the Wnt and {$\beta$}-catenin signaling axis, and accumulated {$\beta$}-catenin, a feature observed in stem cells. In vivo, Th17 cells gave rise to Th1-like effector cell progeny and also self-renewed and persisted as IL-17A-secreting cells. Multipotency was required for Th17 cell-mediated tumor eradication because effector cells deficient in IFN-{$\gamma$} or IL-17A had impaired activity.

In vitro, treatment of naive CD4(+) T cells with IL-27 suppressed the development of Th9 cells, which was partially dependent on the transcription factors STAT-1 and T-bet. Moreover, IL-27 treatment completely abrogated the encephalitogenicity of Th9 cells in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model.

Interleukin (IL)-27 is an IL-12 family cytokine chiefly produced by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, and alone or in combination with other cytokines, IL-27 boosts antitumor immunity by contributing to the development of NK cells and CTLs \textendash{} a central immnunomodulatory effect \textendash{} and by exerting potent antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activities, a local antitumor effect.

Although Crohn's disease (CD) is often described as a prototype of T-helper 1-type diseases, and ulcerative colitis (UC) is traditionally viewed as a T-helper 2-mediated condition, the classic paradigm, which categorises cytokines into pro- and anti-inflammatory groups, has recently been changed. The inflammation regulatory pathways may not be mutually exclusive as individual cytokines can have diverse and even opposing functions in various clinical and immunological settings. None the less there are many common immunological responses in IBD that are mediated by cytokines. Although they regulate and influence the development, course and recurrence of the inflammatory process, the concrete pathogenic role of these small signaling molecules is sometimes not unambiguous in the subtypes of the disease. Our aim is to review the current information about pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of traditionally studied and recently discovered cytokines in the pathogenesis of UC and CD. The better understanding of their production and functional activity may lead to the development of new therapeutic modalities.},

STAT1 is a 91 kDa protein originally identified as the mediator of the cellular response to interferon (IFN) {$\alpha$}, and thereafter found to be a major component of the cellular response to IFN{$\gamma$}. STAT1 is, in fact, involved in the response to several cytokines and to growth factors. It is activated by cytokine receptors via kinases of the JAK family. STAT1 becomes phosphorylated and forms a dimer which enters the nucleus and triggers the transcription of its targets. Although not lethal at birth, selective gene deletion of STAT1 in mice leads to rapid death from severe infections, demonstrating its major role in the response to pathogens. Similarly, in humans who do not express STAT1, there is a lack of resistance to pathogens leading to premature death. This indicates a key, non-redundant function of STAT1 in the defence against pathogens. Thus, to successfully infect organisms, bacterial, viral or parasitic pathogens must overcome the activity of STAT1, and almost all the steps of this pathway can be blocked or inhibited by proteins produced in infected cells. Interestingly, some pathogens, like the oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus, have evolved a strategy which uses STAT1 activation. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

Glycans on cell membrane proteins play important roles in many cellular processes such as recognition and apoptosis, and this study investigated whether changes to the glycan structures on cell membrane proteins occur when cells become resistant to drugs. Specifically, we investigated the alteration of glycan structures on the cell membrane proteins of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CEM) cells that were selected for resistance to desoxyepothilone B (CEM/dEpoB). The glycan profile of the cell membrane glycoproteins was obtained by sequential release of N- and O-glycans from cell membrane fraction dotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with PNGase F and {$\beta$}-elimination respectively. The released glycan alditols were analyzed by liquid chromatography (graphitized carbon)-electrospray ionization tandem MS. The major N-glycan on CEM cell was the core fucosylated {$\alpha$}2\textendash 6 monosialo-biantennary structure. Resistant CEM/dEpoB cells had a significant decrease of {$\alpha$}2\textendash 6 linked sialic acid on N-glycans. The lower {$\alpha$}2\textendash 6 sialylation was caused by a decrease in activity of {$\beta$}-galactoside {$\alpha$}2\textendash 6 sialyltransferase (ST6Gal), and decreased expression of the mRNA. It is clear that the membrane glycosylation of leukemia cells changes during acquired resistance to dEpoB drugs and that this change occurs globally on all cell membrane glycoproteins. This is the first identification of a specific glycan modification on the surface of drug resistant cells and the mechanism of this downstream effect on microtubule targeting drugs may offer a route to new interventions to overcome drug resistance.},

METHODS: Using endoscopic biopsies taken from the gastric antrum of 29 subjects infected with Helicobacter pylori and 22 uninfected subjects, mucosal CXCL13 mRNA and protein levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. RESULTS: The CXCL13 expression levels were significantly more elevated in H. pylori-positive patients than uninfected ones. The CXCL13 expression levels correlated with the degree of chronic gastritis and bacterial colonization. Immunohistochemistry and in vitro infection assay showed that CXCL13 was not produced by the gastric epithelium, but the {$\alpha$}-smooth muscle antigen expressing mesenchymal cells were the possible source of CXCL13 within H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa. CXCR5 immunostaining was seen in the CD20-positive lymphoid aggregates. CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced induction of CXCL13 may be involved in the pathogenesis of H. pylori-associated gastritis.},

  abstract = {Mucin glycoproteins are secreted in large quantities by mucosal epithelia and cell surface mucins are a prominent feature of the glycocalyx of all mucosal epithelia. Currently, studies investigating the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier use either animal experiments or non-in vivo like cell cultures. Many pathogens cause different pathology in mice compared to humans and the in vitro cell cultures used are suboptimal because they are very different from an in vivo mucosal surface, are often not polarized, lack important components of the glycocalyx, and often lack the mucus layer. Although gastrointestinal cell lines exist that produce mucins or polarize, human cell line models that reproducibly create the combination of a polarized epithelial cell layer, functional tight junctions and an adherent mucus layer have been missing until now. We trialed a range of treatments to induce polarization, 3D-organization, tight junctions, mucin production, mucus secretion, and formation of an adherent mucus layer that can be carried out using standard equipment. These treatments were tested on cell lines of intestinal (Caco-2, LS513, HT29, T84, LS174T, HT29 MTX-P8 and HT29 MTX-E12) and gastric (MKN7, MKN45, AGS, NCI-N87 and its hTERT Clone5 and Clone6) origins using Ussing chamber methodology and (immuno)histology. Semi-wet interface culture in combination with mechanical stimulation and DAPT caused HT29 MTX-P8, HT29 MTX-E12 and LS513 cells to polarize, form functional tight junctions, a three-dimensional architecture resembling colonic crypts, and produce an adherent mucus layer. Caco-2 and T84 cells also polarized, formed functional tight junctions and produced a thin adherent mucus layer after this treatment, but with less consistency. In conclusion, culture methods affect cell lines differently, and testing a matrix of methods vs. cell lines may be important to develop better in vitro models. The methods developed herein create in vitro mucosal surfaces suitable for studies of host-pathogen interactions at the mucosal surface.},

Microbiologic culture of H. pylori is the "gold standard" for diagnosis in a patient with suspected infection. Although not currently recommended for routine use, culture allows testing for susceptibility to antimicrobials, especially in populations with a high prevalence of drug resistance. Gastric biopsies are the specimens most commonly used to culture H. pylori, but stool, vomitus, saliva, and dental plaque offer opportunities. This review examines the current methods used to culture H. pylori from biologic specimens and suggests useful hints to enhance its recovery rate.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is not clear how Helicobacter pylori, an apparently extracellular pathogen colonizing the luminal side of the gastric epithelium, invariably causes an immune-inflammatory response on the stromal side of the mucosa. Penetration of H pylori into epithelial cell lines and its interaction with immune-inflammatory cells have been documented in vitro. Several investigations also showed in vivo bacterial penetration into the epithelium up to the lamina propria; however, the identification as H pylori of the bacteria-like bodies observed in unchanged, metaplastic, or neoplastic mucosa remained sometimes questionable. METHODS: To search for bacteria-like organisms, we used transmission electron microscopy on endoscopic biopsy specimens from 20 dyspeptic subjects and surgical specimens of neoplastic and nonneoplastic mucosa from 20 cancerous stomachs. To ascertain the H pylori nature of the organisms found, we used 6 different antibodies directed against bacterial lysates, purified vacuolating cytotoxin A, or purified cytotoxin-associated antigen A in immunogold tests. The results were compared with those of H pylori strains cultivated in vitro. RESULTS: In nonmetaplastic gastric epithelium, cytochemically proven H pylori were detected, in the majority of cases, inside cytoplasm of epithelial cells, in intraepithelial intercellular spaces, and in underlying lamina propria, often in direct contact with immune-inflammatory cells and sometimes inside small blood vessels. Cytochemically proven H pylori were also observed inside 6 of 8 intestinal metaplasias and 9 of 20 cancers. CONCLUSIONS: H pylori penetrates normal, metaplastic, and neoplastic gastric epithelium in vivo, intracellularly, or interstitially to cause a strong immune-inflammatory response and promote gastric carcinogenesis.},

Investigating gastric endoscopic biopsies from dyspeptic patients by means of ultrastructural immunocytochemistry, here we show that, in human superficial-foveolar epithelium and its metaplastic or dysplastic foci, H. pylori virulence factors accumulated in a discrete cytoplasmic structure characterized by 13-nm-thick cylindrical particles of regular punctate-linear substructure resembling the proteasome complex in size and structure. Inside this particle-rich cytoplasmic structure (PaCS) we observed colocalization of VacA, CagA, urease and outer membrane proteins with NOD1 receptor, ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, polyubiquitinated proteins, proteasome components and potentially oncogenic proteins like SHP2 and ERKs in human gastric epithelium. By means of electron and confocal microscopy, we demonstrate that the in vivo findings were reproduced in vitro by incubating human epithelial cell lines with H. pylori products/virulence factors. PaCSs differed from VacA-induced vacuoles, phagosomes, aggresomes or related bodies. Our data suggest that PaCS is a novel, proteasome-enriched structure arising in ribosome-rich cytoplasm at sites of H. pylori products accumulation. As a site of selective concentration of bacterial virulence factors, the ubiquitin-proteasome system and interactive proteins, PaCS is likely to modulate immune-inflammatory and proliferative responses of the gastric epithelium of potential pathologic relevance.},

  abstract = {A mucosal vaccine against Helicobacter pylori infection could help prevent gastric cancers and peptic ulcers. While previous attempts to develop such a vaccine have largely failed because of the requirement for safe and effective adjuvants or large amounts of well defined antigens, we have taken a unique approach to combining our strong mucosal CTA1-DD adjuvant with selected peptides from urease B (UreB). The protective efficacy of the selected peptides together with cholera toxin (CT) was first confirmed. However, CT is a strong adjuvant that unfortunately is precluded from clinical use because of its toxicity. To circumvent this problem we have developed a derivative of CT, the CTA1-DD adjuvant, that has been found safe in non-human primates and equally effective compared to CT when used intranasally. We genetically fused the selected peptides into the CTA1-DD plasmid and found after intranasal immunizations of Balb/c mice using purified CTA1-DD with 3 copies of an H. pylori urease T cell epitope (CTA1-UreB3T-DD) that significant protection was stimulated against a live challenge infection. Protection was, however, weaker than with the gold standard, bacterial lysate+CT, but considering that we only used a single epitope in nanomolar amounts the results convey optimism. Protection was associated with enhanced Th1 and Th17 immunity, but immunizations in IL-17A-deficient mice revealed that IL-17 may not be essential for protection. Taken together, we have provided evidence for the rational design of an effective mucosal subcomponent vaccine against H. pylori infection based on well selected protective epitopes from relevant antigens incorporated into the CTA1-DD adjuvant platform.},

We analyzed genome and methylome variations in a fully virulent strain of H pylori during experimental infection. METHODS: We performed a randomized Phase I/II, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study of 12 healthy, H pylori-negative adults in Germany from October 2008 through March 2010. The volunteers were given a prophylactic vaccine candidate (n~= 7) or placebo (n~= 5) and then challenged with H pylori strain BCM-300. Biopsy samples were collected and H pylori were isolated. Genomes of the challenge strain and 12 reisolates, obtained 12 weeks after (or in 1 case, 62 weeks after) infection were sequenced by single-molecule, real-time technology, which, in parallel, permitted determination of genome-wide methylation patterns for all strains. Functional effects of genetic changes observed in H pylori strains during human infection were assessed by measuring release of interleukin 8 from AGS cells (to detect cag pathogenicity island function), neutral red uptake (to detect vacuolating cytotoxin activity), and adhesion assays. RESULTS: The observed mutation rate was in agreement with rates previously determined from patients with chronic H pylori infections, without evidence of a mutation burst. A loss of cag pathogenicity island function was observed in 3 reisolates. In addition, 3 reisolates from the vaccine group acquired mutations in the vacuolating cytotoxin gene vacA, resulting in loss of vacuolization activity. We observed interstrain variation in methylomes due to phase variation in genes encoding methyltransferases. CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed adaptation of a fully virulent strain of H pylori to 12 different volunteers to obtain a robust estimate of the frequency of genetic and epigenetic changes in the absence of interstrain recombination. Our findings indicate that the large amount of genetic variation in H pylori poses a challenge to vaccine development. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT00736476.},

Here, we have analyzed the mechanisms how IL-27 may drive such divergent immune responses. While IL-27 suppressed the development of proinflammatory Th17 cells, a novel role for this cytokine in inhibiting the development of anti-inflammatory, inducible regulatory T cells (iTreg) was identified. In fact, IL-27 suppressed the development of adaptive, TGF-beta-induced Forkhead box transcription factor p3-positive (Foxp3(+)) Treg. Whereas the blockade of Th17 development was dependent on the transcription factor STAT1, the suppression of iTreg development was STAT1 independent, suggesting that IL-27 utilizes different signaling pathways to shape T cell-driven immune responses. Our data thus demonstrate that IL-27 controls the development of Th17 and iTreg cells via differential effects on STAT1.},

Splicing variation, leading to a 9-amino acid insertion in the signal peptide region, was proposed to be because of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs4072037) at the 5' end of exon 2, but is also reported to be cancer-associated. However, the effect of rs4072037 on this splicing event in healthy non-cancer tissues and on the additional spliceoforms ofMUC1, including those lacking the polymorphic tandem repeat (TR) domain, has never been investigated. Here we show that in both foetal and adult tissues of known genotype, there is clear evidence for the role of rs4072037 in controlling alternative splicing of the 5' exon 2 region of both full-length transcripts and those lacking the TR domain. Although there is some evidence for additional genetic and epigenetic influences, there is no indication of an effect of the TR domain on the proportions of the spliceoforms. In conclusion, over-representation of certain transcripts in tumour material cannot be evaluated without information on the SNP genotype as well.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Recently, the Th1/Th2 paradigm has been expanded by the discovery of Th17 cells, a subset of CD4+ memory T cells characterized by their unique ability to secrete interleukin-17 (IL-17) family cytokines. Importantly, Th17 cells appear to be intimately involved in autoimmunity. We undertook the present study to investigate whether the Th17/IL-23 system is up-regulated in Sj\"ogren's syndrome (SS). METHODS Sera, saliva, and salivary glands from C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice (a model for primary SS), as well as sera, saliva, and salivary gland biopsy specimens obtained from patients with primary SS, were evaluated for IL-17 and IL-23 expression by immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the Luminex system. RESULTS Immunohistochemical stainings of submandibular glands from C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice and of salivary gland biopsy specimens from SS patients revealed strong positive staining for both IL-17 and IL-23 within lymphocytic foci and diffuse staining on epithelial tissues. Temporal expression of IL-17 and IL-23 in submandibular glands of C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice correlated with expression of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gammat, the Th17 cell master control gene. While IL-17 could not be detected in saliva from 4-20-week-old C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice, this cytokine was present in the blood of mice up to age 16 weeks. This contrasted with sera and saliva from SS patients, in which IL-17 and IL-6 were present at varying levels. CONCLUSION These results suggest that the Th17/IL-23 system is up-regulated in C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice and SS patients at the time of disease. A correlation between up-regulated IL-17/IL-23 expression and specific clinical manifestations of SS has yet to be identified.},

The Fc fusion protein of IL-35 induced proliferation of murine CD4(+)CD25(+) and CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells when stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in vitro. The IL-35-expanded CD4(+)CD25(+) T cell population expressed Foxp3 and produced elevated levels of IL-10, whereas the IL-35-induced CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells produced IFN-gamma but not IL-4. The in vitro expanded CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells retained their suppressive functions against CD4(+)CD25(-) effector cells. Furthermore, when cultured with soluble anti-CD3 antibody and antigen-presenting cells, IL-35 suppressed the proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) effector cells. Moreover, IL-35 inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cells in vitro. In vivo, IL-35 effectively attenuated established collagen-induced arthritis in mice, with concomitant suppression of IL-17 production but enhanced IFN-gamma synthesis.

To define the function of EBI3 in vivo, we generated knockout mice in which the ebi3 gene was targeted by homologous recombination. EBI3-/- mice exhibited normal numbers of both naive and mature CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and B cells, but markedly decreased numbers of invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) as defined by staining with an {$\alpha$}-galactosylceramide ({$\alpha$}GalCer)-loaded CD1d-tetramer. iNKT cells from EBI3-/- mice exhibited decreased IL-4 and, to a lesser extent, IFN-{$\gamma$} production after {$\alpha$}GalCer stimulation in vitro. A sustained decrease in IL-4 production was also observed in EBI3-/- mice after {$\alpha$}GalCer stimulation in vivo in contrast to IFN-{$\gamma$} production, which was only transiently decreased under such stimulation. Notably, EBI3-/- mice were resistant to the induction of immunopathology associated with oxazolone-induced colitis, a colitis model mediated primarily by T helper (Th) 2-type cytokine production by iNKT cells. In contrast, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, a predominantly Th1-mediated colitis model, was unaffected. Thus, EBI3 plays a critical regulatory role in the induction of Th2-type immune responses and the development of Th2-mediated tissue inflammation in vivo, which may be mediated through the control of iNKT cell function.},

METHODS Studies using genetically deficient mice have greatly enhanced our understanding of the biology of IL-35. On the basis of data derived from the analysis of these genetically deficient mice published by NIH, we focus on the key features of this heterodimeric cytokine, especially its relation to the other IL-12 family members, and discuss its potential relevance to the clinical usage. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS IL-35 is required for the CD4+CD25+ Treg cells-mediated immune regulation, the alleviation of some inflammatory responses, as well as the expansion of CD4+CD25- Teff cells simultaneously. Moreover, administration or augmentation of IL-35 suppresses some diseases of autoimmune or allergic origin like collagen-induced arthritis or Helicobacter-induced colitis in animal models, demonstrating its potential in therapy of diseases mediated by inflammatory cytokines. However, some questions involving it are still unclear, including the composition of IL-35 receptor, IL-35-related cell signaling pathway, the different expression patterns of IL-35 between human and murine T cells, etc. CONCLUSION As our understanding of the IL-35 is rapidly growing and changing, it will bring us more therapeutic strategies towards some intractable immune diseases such as Lupus Erythematosus.},

  abstract = {The human intestinal mucosa is constantly exposed to commensal microbiota. Since the gut microbiota is beneficial to the host, hosts have evolved intestine-specific immune systems to co-exist with the microbiota. On the other hand, the intestinal microbiota actively regulates the host's immune system, and recent studies have revealed that specific commensal bacterial species induce the accumulation of specific immune cell populations. For instance, segmented filamentous bacteria and Clostridium species belonging to clusters XIVa and IV induce the accumulation of Th17 cells in the small intestine and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in the large intestine, respectively. The immune cells induced by the gut microbiota likely contribute to intestinal homeostasis and influence systemic immunity in the host.},

  abstract = {In several murine models of autoimmune arthritis, Th17 cells are the dominant initiators of inflammation. In human arthritis the majority of IL-17-secreting cells within the joint express a cytokine phenotype intermediate between Th17 and Th1. Here we show that Th17/1 cells from the joints of children with inflammatory arthritis express high levels of both Th17 and Th1 lineage-specific transcription factors, RORC2 and T-bet. Modeling the generation of Th17/1 in vitro, we show that Th17 cells "convert" to Th17/1 under conditions that mimic the disease site, namely low TGFbeta and high IL-12 levels, whereas Th1 cells cannot convert to Th17. Th17/1 cells from the inflamed joint share T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality with Th17 cells, suggesting a shared clonal origin between Th17 and Th17/1 cells in arthritis. Using CD161, a lectin-like receptor that is a marker of human Th17, we show synovial Th17 and Th17/1 cells, and unexpectedly, a large proportion of Th1 cells express CD161. We provide evidence to support a Th17 origin for Th1 cells expressing CD161. In vitro, Th17 cells that convert to a Th1 phenotype maintain CD161 expression. In the joint CD161+ Th1 cells share features with Th17 cells, with shared TCR clonality, expression of RORC2 and CCR6 and response to IL-23, although they are IL-17 negative. We propose that the Th17 phenotype may be unstable and that Th17 cells may convert to Th17/1 and Th1 cells in human arthritis. Therefore therapies targeting the induction of Th17 cells could also attenuate Th17/1 and Th1 effector populations within the inflamed joint.},

Recrudescence (recolonization of the same strain within 12 mo after eradication) rather than reinfection (colonization with a new strain, more than 12 mo after eradication) is considered to be responsible for most of the cases. This observation was confirmed only in developed countries, while in developing countries a recent meta-analysis demonstrated a high rate of reinfection. The proportion of H pylori annual recurrence was 2.67\% and 13.00\% in developed and developing countries, respectively. Nested meta-analysis (only cases with a longer follow-up and a negative (13)CUBT a year after eradication) revealed annual recurrence rate of 1.45\% [relative risk (RR), 0.54] and 12.00\% (RR, 0.92) in developed and developing countries, respectively. These findings support the notion that in developed countries many cases of recurrence are due to recrudescence within the first year after eradication, with a 46\% drop in the recurrence rate after the first year post eradication, while in developing countries reinfection is more pronounced, and continue at the same rate since eradication. A different approach for follow-up after H pylori eradication is probably needed in patients of developing countries, since reinfection is highly prevalent.},

RESULTS: Most bacteria looked curved, but in the duodenal bulb coccoid bacteria were relatively common. Bacteria were often found around intercellular junctions. freeze fracture examination indicated abnormalities of the tight junction complexes in patients with H pylori infection. In many biopsy specimens bacteria were seen closely attached to the epithelial cell membrane by different forms of adhesion. In addition to what looked like intracytoplasmic penetration by bacteria, several examples of genuine penetration were observed. CONCLUSION: H pylori is commonly found adhering to epithelial cells. Occasionally, H pylori may also penetrate cells. These features may contribute to the pathogenic action of the organism.},

Th17 cells represent a pro-inflammatory subset whereas Treg cells have an antagonist effect. Their developmental pathways are reciprocally interconnected and there is an important plasticity between Th17 and Treg cells. These features implicate that the Th17/Treg balance plays a major role in the development and the disease outcomes of animal model and human autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. During these diseases, this balance is disturbed and this promotes the maintenance of inflammation. Targeting the Th17/Treg imbalance can be performed at different levels such as inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and their receptors, of pathogenic cells or their specific signaling pathways. Conversely, direct effects include administration or induction of protective cells, or stimulation of their specific pathways. Several clinical trials are underway and some positive results have been obtained.},

Immunohistochemistry showed MUC5AC to originate from the surface epithelium, whereas MUC6 was produced by the glands. Mucins from the surface epithelium or glands of corpus and antrum were purified using CsCl/4M guanidinium chloride density-gradient centrifugation. MUC5AC appeared as two distinct populations at 1.4 and 1.3 g/ml, whereas MUC6, which was enriched in the gland tissue, appeared at 1.45 g/ml. Reactivity with antibodies against the Le(b) structure (where Le represents the Lewis antigen) followed the MUC5AC distribution, whereas antibodies against the Le(y) structure and reactivity with the GlcNAc-selective Solanum tuberosum lectin coincided with MUC6, suggesting that the two mucins are glycosylated differently. Rate-zonal centrifugation of whole mucins and reduced subunits showed that both gastric MUC5AC and MUC6 are oligomeric glycoproteins composed of disulphide-bond linked subunits and that oligomeric MUC5AC was apparently smaller than MUC6. A heterogeneous population of 'low-density' MUC5AC mucins, which were smaller than the 'high-density' ones both before and after reduction, reacted with an antibody against a variable number tandem repeat sequence within MUC5AC, suggesting that they represent precursor forms of this mucin. Following ion-exchange HPLC, both MUC5AC and MUC6 appeared as several distinct populations, probably corresponding to 'glycoforms' of the mucins, the most highly charged of which were found in the gland tissue.},

To clarify in which extend Helicobacter escapes the antimicrobial defense, we systematically assessed susceptibility and expression levels of different antimicrobial host factors in gastric mucosa with and without H. pylori infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the expression levels of HBD1 (gene name DEFB1), HBD2 (DEFB4A), HBD3 (DEFB103A), HBD4 (DEFB104A), LL37 (CAMP) and elafin (PI3) by real time PCR in gastric biopsy samples in a total of 20 controls versus 12 patients colonized with H. pylori. Immunostaining was performed for HBD2 and HBD3. We assessed antimicrobial susceptibility by flow cytometry, growth on blood agar, radial diffusion assay and electron microscopy. RESULTS: H. pylori infection was associated with increased gastric levels of the inducible defensin HBD2 and of the antiprotease elafin, whereas the expression levels of the constitutive defensin HBD1, inducible HBD3 and LL37 remained unchanged. HBD4 was not expressed in significant levels in gastric mucosa. H. pylori strains were resistant to the defensins HBD1 as well as to elafin, and strain specific minimally susceptible to HBD2, whereas HBD3 and LL37 killed all H. pylori strains effectively. We demonstrated the binding of HBD2 and LL37 on the surface of H. pylori cells. Comparing the antibacterial activity of extracts from H. pylori negative and positive biopsies, we found only a minimal killing against H. pylori that was not increased by the induction of HBD2 in H. pylori positive samples. CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that gastric H. pylori evades the host defense shield to allow colonization.},

Proteins recognized by IgM antibody were identified by mass spectrometry of immunoreactive bands separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Mucosal T-cell subsets (CD4, CD8, CD3, and CD30 cells) were assessed by immunohistochemistry. All 18 infected volunteers developed H. pylori-specific IgM responses to both homologous or heterologous H. pylori antigens. H. pylori antigens reacted with IgM antibody at 4 weeks postinfection. IgM Western blotting showed immunoreactivity of postinfection serum samples to multiple H. pylori proteins with molecular weights ranging between 9,000 (9K) to 150K with homologous strains but only a 70K band using heterologous antigens. Two-dimensional electrophoresis demonstrated that production of H. pylori-specific IgM antibodies was elicited by H. pylori flagellins A and B, urease B, ABC transporter binding protein, heat shock protein 70 (DnaK), and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase. Mucosal CD3, CD4, and CD8 T-cell numbers increased following infection. IgM antibody responses were detected to a range of homologous H. pylori antigens 2 to 4 weeks postchallenge.

Tfh cell generation was regulated by ICOS ligand (ICOSL) expressed on B cells and was dependent on interleukin-21 (IL-21), IL-6, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). However, unlike Th17 cells, differentiation of Tfh cells did not require transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) or Th17-specific orphan nuclear receptors RORalpha and RORgamma in vivo. Finally, naive T cells activated in vitro in the presence of IL-21 but not TGF-beta signaling preferentially acquired Tfh gene expression and promoted germinal-center reactions in vivo. This study thus demonstrates that Tfh is a distinct Th cell lineage.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori is a spiral-shaped Gram-negative microaerophilic bacterium associated with a number of gastrointestinal disorders, including gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. Several studies have implicated a Th17 response as a key to protective immunity against Helicobacter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wild type (WT) and MyD88-deficient (MyD88(-/-)) mice in the C57BL/6 background were infected with H. felis for 6 and 25 weeks and colonization density and host response evaluated. Real-time PCR was used to determine the expression of cytokines and antimicrobial peptides in the gastric tissue of mice. RESULTS: mRNA expression levels of the Th17 cytokines interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-22 were markedly up-regulated in WT compared with MyD88(-/-) mice both at 6 and at 25 weeks in response to infection with H. felis, indicating that induction of Th17 responses depends on MyD88 signaling. Furthermore, reduction in the expression of Th17-dependent intestinal antimicrobial peptide lipocalin-2 was linked with increased bacterial burden in the absence of MyD88 signaling. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence showing that MyD88-dependent signaling is required for the host to induce a Th17 response for the control of Helicobacter infection.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is an important etiologic agent of gastroduodenal disease in humans. In this report, we describe a general genetic approach for the identification of genes encoding exported proteins in H. pylori. The novel TnMax9 mini-blaM transposon was used for insertion mutagenesis of a H. pylori gene library established in Escherichia coli. A total of 192 E. coli clones expressing active beta-lactamase fusion proteins (BlaM+) were obtained, indicating that the corresponding target plasmids carry H. pylori genes encoding putative extracytoplasmic proteins. Natural transformation of H. pylori P1 or P12 using the 192 mutant plasmids resulted in 135 distinct H. pylori mutant strains (70\%). Screening of the H. pylori collection of mutant strains allowed the identification of mutant strains impaired in motility, in natural transformation competence and in adherence to gastric epithelial cell lines. Motility mutants could be grouped into distinct classes: (i) mutant strains lacking the major flagellin subunit FlaA and intact flagella (class I); (ii) mutant strains with apparently normal flagella, but reduced motility (class II), and (iii) mutant strains with obviously normal flagella, but completely abolished motility (class III). Two independent mutations that exhibited defects in natural competence for genetic transformation mapped to different genetic loci. In addition, two independent mutant strains were isolated by their failure to bind to the human gastric carcinoma cell line KatoIII. Both mutant strains carried a transposon in the same gene, 0.8 kb apart, and showed decreased autoagglutination when compared to the wild-type strain.},

  abstract = {The gram-negative gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is equipped with an extraordinarily large set of outer membrane proteins (OMPs), whose role in the infection process is not well understood. The Hop (Helicobacter outer membrane porins) and Hor (Hop-related proteins) groups constitute a large paralogous family consisting of 33 members. The OMPs AlpA, AlpB, BabA, SabA, and HopZ have been identified as adhesins or adherence-associated proteins. To better understand the relevance of these and other OMPs during infection, we analyzed the expression of eight different omp genes (alpA, alpB, babA, babB, babC, sabA, hopM, and oipA) in a set of 200 patient isolates, mostly from symptomatic children or young adults. Virtually all clinical isolates produced the AlpA and AlpB proteins, supporting their essential function. All other OMPs were produced at extremely variable rates, ranging from 35\% to 73\%, indicating a function in close adaptation to the individual host or gastric niche. In 11\% of the isolates, BabA was produced, and SabA was produced in 5\% of the isolates, but the strains failed to bind their cognate substrates. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression in gastric cells was strictly dependent on the presence of the cag pathogenicity island, whereas the presence of OipA clearly enhanced IL-8 production. The presence of the translocated effector protein CagA correlated well with BabA and OipA production. In conclusion, we found unexpectedly diverse omp expression profiles in individual H. pylori strains and hypothesize that this reflects the selective pressure for adhesion, which may differ across different hosts as well as within an individual over time.},

  abstract = {Infection with the gastric bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori is typically contracted in early childhood and often persists for decades. The immunomodulatory properties of H. pylori that allow it to colonize humans persistently are believed to also account for H. pylori's protective effects against allergic and chronic inflammatory diseases. H. pylori infection efficiently reprograms dendritic cells (DCs) toward a tolerogenic phenotype and induces regulatory T cells (Tregs) with highly suppressive activity in models of allergen-induced asthma. We show here that two H. pylori virulence determinants, the {$\gamma$}-glutamyl transpeptidase GGT and the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA, contribute critically and nonredundantly to H. pylori's tolerizing effects on murine DCs in vitro and in vivo. The tolerance-promoting effects of both factors are independent of their described suppressive activity on T cells. Isogenic H. pylori mutants lacking either GGT or VacA are incapable of preventing LPS-induced DC maturation and fail to drive DC tolerization as assessed by induction of Treg properties in cocultured naive T cells. The {$\Delta$}ggt and {$\Delta$}vacA mutants colonize mice at significantly reduced levels, induce stronger T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 17 (Th17) responses, and/or trigger more severe gastric pathology. Both factors promote the efficient induction of Tregs in vivo, and VacA is required to prevent allergen-induced asthma. The defects of the {$\Delta$}ggt mutant in vitro and in vivo are phenocopied by pharmacological inhibition of the transpeptidase activity of GGT in all readouts. In conclusion, our results reveal the molecular players and mechanistic basis for H. pylori-induced immunomodulation, promoting persistent infection and conferring protection against allergic asthma.},

Recently, the vacA intermediate (i) region, which is located between the signal (s) and middle (m) regions, was identified as a third polymorphic determinant of vacA activity. In vacA, there are approximately 81-bp deletions between the vacA i and m regions (denoted the d region). The aim was to clarify the roles of the vacA d region in relation to H. pylori-related diseases and histopathological gastric mucosal changes. We assessed the vacA signal s-, m-, i-, and d-region genotypes and cagA status in H. pylori isolates recovered from Western countries (n = 266) and East Asian countries (n = 244) by PCR. In East Asian countries, there were no relationships between the vacA genotypes and the clinical outcomes and histopathological changes. In Western countries, strains with the vacA s1, m1, i1, or d1 (no deletion) genotype significantly increased the risk for the development of gastric cancer compared with the risk from strains with the s2, m2, i2, or d2 genotype (adjusted odd ratios, 3.17 [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, 1.07 to 9.45] for s1, 10.65 [95\% CI, 3.36 to 31.35] for m1, 8.57 [95\% CI, 2.85 to 25.81] for i1, and 8.04 [95\% CI, 2.67 to 24.16] for d1). The highly virulent vacA genotypes significantly enhanced neutrophil infiltration and gastric atrophy in univariant analysis, whereas only the vacA d-region genotype was significantly associated with neutrophil infiltration and gastric atrophy in both the antrum and the corpus by multiple linear regression analysis. The presence of the vacA d1 genotype in H. pylori strains could be an improved predictor of histological inflammation and the potential for atrophy compared with the presence of the vacA s-, m-, and i-region genotypes in Western countries.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori causes chronic gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcers, and gastric cancer, and has been treated with two antibiotics (amoxicillin and clarithromycin) and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). However, antibiotic treatment alters the indigenous gut microbiota to cause side effects. Therefore, the effects of probiotic supplementation on therapy have been studied. Although several studies have covered the probiotics' effects, details about the gut microbiota changes after H. pylori eradication have not been evaluated. Therefore, we analyzed the influences of antibiotics and their combination with probiotics on the composition of the gut microbiota using high-throughput sequencing. METHODS: Subjects were divided into two groups. The antibiotics group was treated with general therapy, and the probiotics group with general therapy and probiotic supplementation. Fecal samples were collected from all subjects during treatments, and the influences on gut microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene-pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Three phyla, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, were predominant in the gut microbiota of all subjects. After treatment, the relative abundances of Firmicutes were reduced, whereas those of Proteobacteria were increased in both groups. However, the changed proportions of the gut microbiota in the antibiotics group were higher than those in the probiotics group. In addition, the increase in the levels of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was higher in the antibiotics group than in the probiotics one. CONCLUSION: Probiotic supplementation can reduce the antibiotic-induced alteration and imbalance of the gut microbiota composition. This effect may restrict the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the gut and improve the H. pylori eradication success rate.},

Here we showed that Treg cell development was achieved by the combination of two independent processes, i.e., the expression of Foxp3 and the establishment of Treg cell-specific CpG hypomethylation pattern. Both events were induced by T cell receptor stimulation. The Treg cell-type CpG hypomethylation began in the thymus and continued to proceed in the periphery and could be fully established without Foxp3. The hypomethylation was required for Foxp3(+) T cells to acquire Treg cell-type gene expression, lineage stability, and full suppressive activity. Thus, those T cells in which the two events have concurrently occurred are developmentally set into the Treg cell lineage. This model explains how Treg cell fate and plasticity is controlled and can be exploited to generate functionally stable Treg cells.},

To demonstrate the functional effects of IL-18 on human IELs, we assessed IL-18/IL-18 receptor expression in IEC/IEL and proliferation following stimulation of intestinal IELs by IL-18. IL-18 transcripts were detected both in freshly isolated human colonic epithelial cells and in various colonic epithelial cell lines.

Furthermore, IELs constitutively expressed the IL-18 receptor in addition to the IL-2 and IL-7 receptors. More importantly, IL-18 augmented significant proliferative responses of IEL in combination with IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 both in the presence and in absence of anti-CD3 MoAb.

  abstract = {Infection by the gastroduodenal pathogen Helicobacter pylori elicits a complex immunologic response in the mucosa involving neutrophils, plasma cells, eosinophils, and lymphocytes, of which T cells are the principal orchestrators of immunity. While so-called classical T cells (e.g. T-helper cells) that are activated by peptide fragments presented on antigen-presenting cells have received much attention in H. pylori infection, there exists a diverse array of other T cell populations that are potentially important for the outcome of the ensuing immune response, some of which have not been extensively studied in H. pylori infection. Pathogen-specific regulatory T cells that control and prevent the development of immunopathology associated with H. pylori infection have been investigated, but these cells can also benefit the bacterium in helping to prolong the chronicity of the infection by suppressing protective immune responses. An overlooked T cell population, the more recently described Th17 cells, may play a role in H. pylori-induced inflammation, due to triggering responses that ultimately lead to the recruitment of polymorphs, including neutrophils. The so-called innate or unconventional T cells, that include two conserved T cell subsets expressing invariant antigen-specific receptors, the CD1d-restricted natural killer T cells which are activated by glycolipids, and the mucosal-associated invariant T cells which play a role in defense against orally acquired pathogens in the intestinal mucosa, have only begun to receive attention. A greater knowledge of the range of T cell responses induced by H. pylori is required for a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of this bacterium and its ability to perpetuate chronic infection, and could reveal new strategies for therapeutic exploitation.},

The resistance is due to three point mutations in two positions on the 23S rRNA (A2142C, A2142G, and A2143G). Our aim was to develop a rapid and accurate method to detect these mutations directly on biopsy specimens. We developed a real-time PCR that included a simultaneous detection of the amplicons by hybridization of two probes labeled with LC-Red and fluorescein by using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technology and melting curve analysis with the LightCycler thermocycler. The assay was first applied successfully on reference strains, reference plasmids, and H. pylori-negative biopsies. Biopsies from 200 patients having failed a first eradication attempt and for whom the H. pylori strain was available were then tested with the new assay. A result was obtained in 199 cases; a single genotype was detected in 157 cases, two genotypes were detected in 41 cases, and three genotypes were detected in one case. There were, in total, seven discrepancies between the real-time PCR and the phenotypic method of determination of clarithromycin susceptibility, and in an additional four cases the two phenotypic methods were in disagreement. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism was applied to a sampling of biopsies, including all of the cases with multiple genotypes and all the cases with discrepant results. Finally, in four cases with discrepant results, the real-time PCR detected the resistant population at a concentration so low that it could not be detected by the phenotypic method, while in three cases other mutations could be involved. This assay had an accuracy at least as satisfactory as that of the phenotypic tests and could be performed within 2 h, allowing it to be used before the administration of therapy in the case of a first H. pylori eradication.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is one of the most successful human pathogens, which colonizes the mucus layer of the gastric epithelium of more than 50\% of the world's population. This curved, microaerophilic, Gram-negative bacterium induces a chronic active gastritis, often asymptomatic, in all infected individuals. In some cases, this gastritis evolves to more severe diseases such as peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. H. pylori has developed a unique set of factors, actively supporting its successful survival and persistence in its natural hostile ecological niche, the human stomach, throughout the individual's life, unless treated. In the human stomach, the vast majority of H. pylori cells are motile in the mucus layer lining, but a small percentage adheres to the epithelial cell surfaces. Adherence to the gastric epithelium is important for the ability of H. pylori to cause disease because this intimate attachment facilitates: (1) colonization and persistence, by preventing the bacteria from being eliminated from the stomach, by mucus turnover and gastric peristalsis; (2) evasion from the human immune system and (3) efficient delivery of proteins into the gastric cell, such as the CagA oncoprotein. Therefore, bacteria with better adherence properties colonize the host at higher densities. H. pylori is one of the most genetically diverse bacterial species known and is equipped with an extraordinarily large set of outer membrane proteins, whose role in the infection and persistence process will be discussed in this review, as well as the different receptor structures that have been so far described for mucosal adherence.},

  abstract = {T-helper 17 (Th17) and T-regulatory (Treg) cells are frequently found at barrier surfaces, particularly within the intestinal mucosa, where they function to protect the host from pathogenic microorganisms and to restrain excessive effector T-cell responses, respectively. Despite their differing functional properties, Th17 cells and Tregs share similar developmental requirements. In fact, the fate of antigen-na\"ive T-cells to either Th17 or Treg lineages is finely regulated by key mediators, including TGF{$\beta$}, IL-6, and all-trans retinoic acid. Importantly, the intestinal microbiome also provides immunostimulatory signals, which can activate innate and downstream adaptive immune responses. Specific components of the gut microbiome have been implicated in the production of proinflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells, such as IL-6, IL-23, IL-1{$\beta$}, and the subsequent generation and expansion of Th17 cells. Similarly, commensal bacteria and their metabolites can also promote the generation of intestinal Tregs that can actively induce mucosal tolerance. As such, dysbiosis of the gut microbiome may not solely represent a consequence of gut inflammation, but rather shape the Treg/Th17 commitment and influence susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease. In this review, we discuss Treg and Th17 cell plasticity, its dynamic regulation by the microbiome, and highlight its impact on intestinal homeostasis and disease.},

However, the antitumor effects were mainly evaluated in relatively highly immunogenic tumors and have not been fully evaluated against nonimmunogenic or poorly immunogenic tumors. In this study, we investigated the antitumor efficacies of IL-23 and IL-27 on poorly immunogenic B16F10 melanoma and found that the antitumor responses mediated by IL-23 and IL-27 were clearly different. In syngeneic mice, mouse single-chain (sc) IL-23-transfected B16F10 (B16/IL-23) tumors exhibited almost the same growth curve as B16F10 parental tumor about until day 20 after tumor injection and then showed growth inhibition or even regression. In contrast, scIL-27-transfected B16F10 (B16/IL-27) tumors exhibited significant retardation of tumor growth from the early stage. In vivo depletion assay revealed that the antitumor effect of B16/IL-23 was mainly mediated by CD8+ T cells and IFN-gamma whereas that of B16/IL-27 mainly involved natural killer cells and was independent of IFN-gamma. We also found that antitumor effects of B16/IL-23 and B16/IL-27 were synergistically enhanced by treatment with IL-18 and IL-12, respectively. Furthermore, B16/IL-23-vaccinated mice developed protective immunity against parental B16F10 tumors but B16/IL-27-vaccinated mice did not. When combined with prior in vivo depletion of CD25+ T cells, 80\% of B16/IL-23-vaccinated mice completely rejected subsequent tumor challenge. Finally, we showed that the systemic administration of neither IL-23 nor IL-27 induced such intense toxicity as IL-12. Our data support that IL-23 and IL-27 might play a role in future cytokine-based immunotherapy against poorly immunogenic tumors.},

  abstract = {The transcription factor Foxp3 controls the differentiation and function of regulatory T-cells (Treg). Studies in the past decades identified numerous Foxp3-interacting protein partners. However, it is still not clear how Foxp3 produces the Treg-type transcriptomic landscape through cooperating with its partners. Here I show the current understanding of how Foxp3 transcription factor complexes regulate the differentiation, maintenance and functional maturation of Treg. Importantly, T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling plays central roles in Treg differentiation and Foxp3-mediated gene regulation. Differentiating Treg will have recognized their cognate antigens and received TCR signals before initiating Foxp3 transcription, which is triggered by TCR-induced transcription factors including NFAT, AP-1 and NF-{$\kappa$}B. Once expressed, Foxp3 seizes TCR signal-induced transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms through interacting with AML1/Runx1 and NFAT. Thus, Foxp3 modifies gene expression dynamics of TCR-induced genes, which constitute cardinal mechanisms for Treg-mediated immune suppression. Next, I discuss the following key topics, proposing new mechanistic models for Foxp3-mediated gene regulation: (i) how Foxp3 transcription is induced and maintained by the Foxp3-inducing enhanceosome and the Foxp3 autoregulatory transcription factor complex; (ii) molecular mechanisms for effector Treg differentiation (i.e. Treg maturation); (iii) how Foxp3 activates or represses its target genes through recruiting coactivators and corepressors; (iv) the 'decision-making' Foxp3-containing transcription factor complex for Th17 and Treg differentiation; and (v) the roles of post-translational modification in Foxp3 regulation. Thus, this article provides cutting-edge understanding of molecular biology of Foxp3 and Treg, integrating findings by biochemical and genomic studies.},

Recombinant AhpC was cloned, over-expressed and purified in an unmodified form and was also engineered to incorporate N and C-terminal mannose residues when expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Mice were immunized systemically and mucosally with AhpC and systemically with mAhpC prior to challenge with H. pylori. Serum IgG responses to AhpC were determined and quantitative culture was used to determine the efficacy of vaccination strategies. Systemic prophylactic immunization with AhpC/alum and mAhpC/alum conferred protection against infection in 55\% and 77.3\% of mice, respectively. Mucosal immunization with AhpC/cholera toxin did not protect against infection and elicited low levels of serum IgG in comparison with systemic immunization.

IL-4 and IL-4delta2 mRNAs were evaluated in microdissected gastric epithelium and in AGS cell lines co-cultured with H. pylori B128 or SS1 strains.

The IL-4 mRNA expression was low in H. pylori?infected patients, and markedly reduced in cag-PAI-positive ones. IL-4delta2 mRNA was expressed on gastric epithelium of H. pylori-infected patients, but not in healthy subjects. The IL-4delta2 expression was lower in cag-PAI-positive than in cag-PAI-negative H. pylori infected patients. AGS cells also produced IL-4 mRNA upon SS1 strain stimulation, whereas IL-4delta2 mRNA expression was detected in AGS co-cultured with either SS1 or B128 strains. An inverse correlation was documented between IL-4 and IL-4delta2 mRNA expression by microdissected gastric epithelial cells and the score of gastritis. IL-4, but not IL-4delta2, is expressed by gastric epithelium of healthy subjects, whereas IL-4delta2 and lesser IL-4 mRNA are detectable in the gastric epithelium of H. pylori-infected patients.

Here, we show that mouse CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg can be converted into a hybrid T-cell population characterized by the expression of Foxp3 and ROR-gammat and the production of IL-17.

These results indicate that some Foxp3(+) T cells can produce IL-17 while retaining Foxp3 expression and suggest that Treg could play an unexpected pro-inflammatory role in some settings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Helicobacter mustelae causes gastritis, ulcers and gastric cancer in ferrets and other mustelids. H. mustelae remains the only helicobacter other than H. pylori that causes gastric ulceration and cancer in its natural host. To improve understanding of H. mustelae pathogenesis, and the ulcerogenic and carcinogenic potential of helicobacters in general, we sequenced the H. mustelae genome, and identified 425 expressed proteins in the envelope and cytosolic proteome. RESULTS The H. mustelae genome lacks orthologs of major H. pylori virulence factors including CagA, VacA, BabA, SabA and OipA. However, it encodes ten autotransporter surface proteins, seven of which were detected in the expressed proteome, and which, except for the Hsr protein, are of unknown function. There are 26 putative outer membrane proteins in H. mustelae, some of which are most similar to the Hof proteins of H. pylori. Although homologs of putative virulence determinants of H. pylori (NapA, plasminogen adhesin, collagenase) and Campylobacter jejuni (CiaB, Peb4a) are present in the H. mustelae genome, it also includes a distinct complement of virulence-related genes including a haemagglutinin/haemolysin protein, and a glycosyl transferase for producing blood group A/B on its lipopolysaccharide. The most highly expressed 264 proteins in the cytosolic proteome included many corresponding proteins from H. pylori, but the rank profile in H. mustelae was distinctive. Of 27 genes shown to be essential for H. pylori colonization of the gerbil, all but three had orthologs in H. mustelae, identifying a shared set of core proteins for gastric persistence. CONCLUSIONS The determination of the genome sequence and expressed proteome of the ulcerogenic species H mustelae provides a comparative model for H. pylori to investigate bacterial gastric carcinogenesis in mammals, and to suggest ways whereby cag minus H. pylori strains might cause ulceration and cancer.

Gastric fluids and dental plaques were also collected for fqPCR analysis. RESULTS: 38 children (27.5\%) were considered positive for H. pylori infection by gold standard (concordant positive results on 2 or more tests). The remaining 100 children (72.5\%) were considered negative for H. pylori. Gastric mucosa fqPCR not only detected all 38 H. pylori positive patients but also detected 8 (8\%) of the 100 gold standard-negative children or 11 (10.7\%) of the 103 routine histology-negative samples. Therefore, gastric mucosa fqPCR identified 46 children (33.3\%) with H. pylori infection, significantly higher than gold standard or routine histology (P{$<$}0.01). Both gastric fluid and dental plaque fqPCR only detected 32 (23.2\%) and 30 (21.7\%) children with H. pylori infection respectively and was significantly less sensitive than mucosa fqPCR (P{$<$}0.05) but was as sensitive as non-invasive UBT. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric mucosa fqPCR was more sensitive than routine histology, RUT, 13C-UBT alone or in combination to detect H. pylori infection in children with chronic gastritis. Either gastric fluid or dental plaque PCR is as reliable as 13C-UBT for H. pylori detection.},

  abstract = {IL-27, a novel member of the IL-6/IL-12 family, activates both STAT1 and STAT3 through its receptor, which consists of WSX-1 and gp130 subunits, resulting in positive and negative regulations of immune responses. We recently demonstrated that IL-27 induces Th1 differentiation through ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction in a STAT1-dependent, but T-bet-independent mechanism. In this study, we further investigated the molecular mechanisms by focusing on p38 MAPK and ERK1/2. IL-27-induced Th1 differentiation was partially inhibited by lack of T-bet expression or by blocking ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction with anti-ICAM-1 and/or anti-LFA-1, and further inhibited by both. Similarly, the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, or the inhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, PD98059, partially suppressed IL-27-induced Th1 differentiation and the combined treatment completely suppressed it. p38 MAPK was then revealed to be located upstream of T-bet, and SB203580, but not PD98059, inhibited T-bet-dependent Th1 differentiation. In contrast, ERK1/2 was shown to be located downstream of ICAM-1/LFA-1, and PD98059, but not SB203580, inhibited ICAM-1/LFA-1-dependent Th1 differentiation. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that STAT1 is important for IL-27-induced activation of ERK1/2, but not p38 MAPK, and that IL-27 directly induces mRNA expression of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45gamma, which is known to mediate activation of p38 MAPK. Finally, IL-12Rbeta2 expression was shown to be up-regulated by IL-27 in both T-bet- and ICAM-1/LFA-1-dependent mechanisms. Taken together, these results suggest that IL-27 induces Th1 differentiation via two distinct pathways, p38 MAPK/T-bet- and ICAM-1/LFA-1/ERK1/2-dependent pathways. This is in contrast to IL-12, which induces it via only p38 MAPK/T-bet-dependent pathway.},

In our most recent work we described a possible mechanism by which H. pylori can reduce the risk of developing IBD. Specifically, we were able to demonstrate the immuno-regulatory properties of the H. pylori genome and its ability to downregulate inflammatory responses through interaction with mucosal dendritic cells both in an in vitro and in vivo model. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate the ability of H. pylori DNA to downregulate dendritic cell production of IL-12 and type I interferon, two pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the present work, we conducted further studies to examine the unique properties of the H. pylori genome and the exact mechanism through which it interacts with dendritic cells. Our data highlight a specific immuno-regulatory sequence (IRS), TTTAGGG, which occurs significantly more frequently as compared with other IRS sequences and is unique to the H. pylori genome. Additionally, we illustrate that H. pylori DNA has no effect on modulating the TLR-4 dependent LPS-induction of dendritic cell IL-12 production. This indicates that the inhibitory effect of H. pylori genomic DNA is restricted to the TLR-9 signaling pathway that senses bacterial DNA. In conclusion, the findings of this addendum strengthen the evidence for unique immunoregulatory properties of the H. pylori genome and revealed the importance of TLR-9 mediated mechanism in the pathogenesis of IBD.},

  abstract = {Many strains of Helicobacter pylori are naturally competent for transformation and able to transfer chromosomal DNA among different isolates using a conjugation-like mechanism. In this study, we sought to determine whether H. pylori can transfer DNA into Campylobacter jejuni, a closely related species of the Campylobacterales group. To monitor the transfer, a chromosomally encoded streptomycin resistance cassette prearranged by a specific mutation in the rpsL gene of H. pylori was used. Mating of the bacteria on plates or in liquid broth medium produced C. jejuni progeny containing the streptomycin marker. DNA transfer was unidirectional, from H. pylori to C. jejuni, and the progeny were genetically identical to C. jejuni recipient strains. DNase I treatment reduced but did not eliminate transfer, and DNase I-treated cell supernatants did not transform, ruling out phage transduction. Recombinants also did not occur when the mating bacteria were separated by a membrane, suggesting that DNA transfer requires cell-to-cell contact. Transfer of the streptomycin marker was independent of the H. pylori comB transformation system, the cag pathogenicity island, and another type IV secretion system called tfs3. These findings indicated that a DNase I-resistant, conjugation-like mechanism may contribute to horizontal DNA transfer between different members of the Campylobacteriales group. The significance of this DNA uptake by C. jejuni in the context of acquiring antibiotic resistance is discussed.},

Here we present an exploratory UPLC-MS study of human urine in the context of febrile, complicated urinary tract infection aimed to reveal and identify possible markers of a host response on infection. A UPLC-MS based workflow, taking advantage of Ultra High Resolution (UHR) Qq-ToF-MS, and multivariate data handling were applied to a carefully selected group of 39 subjects with culture-confirmed febrile Escherichia coli UTI. Using a combination of unsupervised and supervised multivariate modeling we have pinpointed a number of peptides specific for UTI. An unequivocal structural identification of these peptides, as O-glycosylated fragments of the human fibrinogen alpha 1 chain, required MS2 and MS3 experiments on two different MS platforms: ESI-UHR-Qq-ToF and ESI-ion trap, a blast search and, finally, confirmation was achieved by matching experimental tandem mass spectra with those of custom synthesized candidate-peptides. In conclusion, exploiting non-targeted UPLC-MS based approach for the investigation of UTI related changes in urine, we have identified and structurally characterized unique O-glycopeptides, which are, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of O-glycosylation of human fibrinogen alpha 1-chain.},

Bacterial isolates harbor numerous well-known adhesins, vacuolating cytotoxin VacA, protease HtrA, urease, peptidoglycan, and type IV secretion systems (T4SS). It appears that H. pylori targets more than 40 known host protein receptors on epithelial or immune cells. A series of T4SS components such as CagL, CagI, CagY, and CagA can bind to the integrin {$\alpha$}5{$\beta$}1 receptor. Other targeted membrane-based receptors include the integrins {$\alpha$}v{$\beta$}3, {$\alpha$}v{$\beta$}5, and {$\beta$}2 (CD18), RPTP-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$}, GP130, E-cadherin, fibronectin, laminin, CD46, CD74, ICAM1/LFA1, T-cell receptor, Toll-like receptors, and receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and c-Met. In addition, H. pylori is able to activate the intracellular receptors NOD1, NOD2, and NLRP3 with important roles in innate immunity. Here we review the interplay of various bacterial factors with host protein receptors. The contribution of these interactions to signal transduction and pathogenesis is discussed.},

  abstract = {More than 50\% of the world's population is infected with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Chronic infection with this Gram-negative pathogen is associated with the development of peptic ulcers and is linked to an increased risk of gastric cancer. H. pylori secretes many proteinaceous factors that are important for initial colonization and subsequent persistence in the host stomach. One of the major protein toxins secreted by H. pylori is the Vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA). After secretion from the bacteria via a type V autotransport secretion system, the 88 kDa VacA toxin (comprised of the p33 and p55 subunits) binds to host cells and is internalized, causing severe ``vacuolation'' characterized by the accumulation of large vesicles that possess hallmarks of both late endosomes and early lysosomes. The development of ``vacuoles'' has been attributed to the formation of VacA anion-selective channels in membranes. Apart from its vacuolating effects, it has recently become clear that VacA also directly affects mitochondrial function. Earlier studies suggested that the p33 subunit, but not the p55 subunit of VacA, could enter mitochondria to modulate organelle function. This raised the possibility that a mechanism separate from pore formation may be responsible for the effects of VacA on mitochondria, as crystallography studies and structural modeling predict that both subunits are required for a physiologically stable pore. It has also been suggested that the mitochondrial effects observed are due to indirect effects on pro-apoptotic proteins and direct effects on mitochondrial morphology-related processes. Other studies have shown that both the p55 and p33 subunits can indeed be efficiently imported into mammalian-derived mitochondria raising the possibility that they could re-assemble to form a pore. Our review summarizes and consolidates the recent advances in VacA toxin research, with focus on the outstanding controversies in the field and the key remaining questions that need to be addressed.},

  abstract = {The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is a major cause of acute chronic gastritis and the development of stomach and duodenal ulcers. Chronic infection furthermore pre-disposes to the development of gastric cancer. Crucial to H. pylori survival within the hostile environment of the digestive system are the adhesins SabA and BabA; these molecules belong to the same protein family and permit the bacteria to bind tightly to sugar moieties LewisB and sialyl-LewisX, respectively, on the surface of epithelial cells lining the stomach and duodenum. Currently, no representative SabA / BabA structure has been determined, however, hampering the development of strategies to eliminate persistent H. pylori infections that fail to respond to conventional therapy. Here, using X-ray crystallography, we show that the soluble extracellular adhesin domain of SabA shares distant similarity to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) fold family. The molecule broadly resembles a golf putter in shape, with the head region featuring a large cavity surrounded by loops that vary in sequence between different H. pylori strains. The N-terminal and C-terminal helices protrude at right angles from the head domain and together form a shaft that connects to a predicted outer membrane protein (OMP)-like {$\beta$}-barrel trans-membrane domain. Using surface plasmon resonance, we were able to detect binding of the SabA adhesin domain to sialyl-LewisX and LewisX but not to LewisA, LewisB or LewisY. Substitution of the highly conserved glutamine residue 159 in the predicted ligand-binding pocket abrogates the binding of the SabA adhesin domain to sialyl-LewisX and LewisX. Taken together, these data suggest that the adhesin domain of SabA is sufficient in isolation for specific ligand binding.},

Trans-epithelial electric resistance (TER) of monolayers formed by canine kidney MDCK I, human gut T84, and murine mammary gland epH4, was lowered by acid-activated VacA. Independent of the cell type and of the starting TER value, VacA reduced it to a minimal value of 1,000-1,300 Omega x cm2. TER decrease was paralleled by a three- to fourfold increase of [14C]-mannitol (molecular weight 182.2) and a twofold increase of [14C]-sucrose (molecular weight 342.3) transmonolayer flux. On the contrary, transmembrane flux of the proinflammatory model tripeptide [14C]-N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (molecular weight 437.6), of [3H]-inuline (molecular weight 5,000) and of HRP (molecular weight 47,000) did not change. These data indicate that VacA increases paracellular epithelial permeability to molecules with molecular weight {$<$} 350-440. Accordingly, the epithelial permeability of Fe3+ and Ni2+ ions, essential for H. pylori survival in vivo, was also increased by VacA. High-resolution immunofluorescence and SDS-PAGE analysis failed to reveal alterations of junctional proteins ZO-1, occludin, cingulin, and E-cadherin. It is proposed that induction by VacA of a selective permeabilization of the epithelial paracellular route to low molecular weight molecules and ions may serve to supply nutrients, which favor H. pylori growth in vivo.},

  abstract = {IL-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of the IL-12p40 ``soluble receptor'' subunit and a novel cytokine-like subunit related to IL-12p35, termed p19. Human and mouse IL-23 exhibit some activities similar to IL-12, but differ in their capacities to stimulate particular populations of memory T cells. Like IL-12, IL-23 binds to the IL-12R subunit IL-12R{$\beta$}1. However, it does not use IL-12R{$\beta$}2. In this study, we identify a novel member of the hemopoietin receptor family as a subunit of the receptor for IL-23, ``IL-23R.'' IL-23R pairs with IL-12R{$\beta$}1 to confer IL-23 responsiveness on cells expressing both subunits. Human IL-23, but not IL-12, exhibits detectable affinity for human IL-23R. Anti-IL-12R{$\beta$}1 and anti-IL-23R Abs block IL-23 responses of an NK cell line and Ba/F3 cells expressing the two receptor chains. IL-23 activates the same Jak-stat signaling molecules as IL-12: Jak2, Tyk2, and stat1, -3, -4, and -5, but stat4 activation is substantially weaker and different DNA-binding stat complexes form in response to IL-23 compared with IL-12. IL-23R associates constitutively with Jak2 and in a ligand-dependent manner with stat3. The ability of cells to respond to IL-23 or IL-12 correlates with expression of IL-23R or IL-12R{$\beta$}2, respectively. The human IL-23R gene is on human chromosome 1 within 150 kb of IL-12R{$\beta$}2.},

Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori is the dominant cause of gastric cancer, and two recent randomized trials showed that H. pylori eradication significantly decreased gastric cancer risk. Population screening and treating individuals for H. pylori also appears to be cost-effective. Nevertheless, current clinical guidelines differ as to whether asymptomatic adults should be screened and treated for H. pylori, and no countries have yet implemented eradication programs. Some of this inaction may reflect lingering doubts about the effectiveness of H. pylori eradication in preventing gastric cancer, but there is also uncertainty about possible risks of mass antibiotic treatment and its impact on gut flora. Appropriately designed studies will help address these issues and hasten the implementation of population-wide prevention programs.},

  abstract = {Alteration of microbiota has been associated with intestinal, inflammatory, and neurological diseases. Abundance of "good bacteria" such as Bifidobacterium, or their products have been generally believed to be beneficial for any diseases, while "bad bacteria" such as pathogenic Helicobacter pylori are assumed to be always detrimental for hosts. However, this is not the case when we compare and contrast the association of the gut microbiota with two neurological diseases, multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Following H. pylori infection, pro-inflammatory T helper (Th)1 and Th17 immune response are initially induced to eradicate bacteria. However, H. pylori evades the host immune response by inducing Th2 cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) that produce anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10. Suppression of anti-bacterial Th1/Th17 cells by Tregs may enhance gastric H. pylori propagation, followed by a cascade reaction involving vitamin B12 and folic acid malabsorption, plasma homocysteine elevation, and reactive oxygen species induction. This can damage the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to accumulation of amyloid-{$\beta$} in the brain, a hallmark of AD. On the other hand, this suppression of pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 responses to H. pylori has protective effects on the hosts, since it prevents uncontrolled gastritis as well as suppresses the induction of encephalitogenic Th1/Th17 cells, which can mediate neuroinflammation in MS. The above scenario may explain why chronic H. pylori infection is positively associated with AD, while it is negatively associated with MS. Lastly, we list "10 pitfalls of microbiota studies", which will be useful for evaluating and designing clinical and experimental microbiota studies.},

Nitric oxide strongly but reversibly inhibited the oxygen consumption by sonicated membranes from H. pylori and Triton X-100-treated cells. Although the sensitivity of the H. pylori respiration to cyanide was low, it also increased after the treatment with Triton X-100. Kinetic analyses revealed that NO was rapidly degraded by E. coli and the Triton X-100-treated H. pylori, but not by the intact H. pylori. Thus, the low sensitivity to NO might reflect the low affinity of the cytochrome c oxidase for this radical within the membrane/lipid bilayers of H. pylori. Such properties of the oxidase in H. pylori membranes may, at least in part, underlie the mechanism by which this bacterium thrives in NO-enriched gastric juice.},

Japanese researchers have found that H. pylori eradication halts progressive mucosal damage and that successful eradication in patients with non-atrophic gastritis most likely prevents subsequent development of gastric cancer. However, those who have already developed atrophic gastritis/gastric atrophy retain potential risk factors for gastric cancer. Because chronic perpetuated progression of H. pylori-associated gastric inflammation is associated with increased morbidity culminating in gastric carcinogenesis, a non-microbial approach to treatment that provides long-term control of gastric inflammation through nutrients and other interventions may be an effective way to decrease this morbidity. This non-microbial approach might represent a new form of prerequisite "rescue" therapy that provides a quicker path to the prevention of gastric cancer as compared to simple eradication.},

J Biol Chem 285: 20547-20557, 2010) demonstrated that expression of MUC1 in AGS gastric epithelial cells limits Helicobacter pylori infection and reduces bacterial-driven IL-8 production. In this study, we identified the peroxisome proliferator-associated receptor-{$\gamma$} (PPAR{$\gamma$}) upstream of MUC1 in the anti-inflammatory pathway suppressing H. pylori- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated IL-8 production. Treatment of AGS cells with H. pylori or PMA increased IL-8 levels in cell culture supernatants compared with cells treated with the respective vehicle controls. Prior small interfering (si)RNA-induced MUC1 silencing further increased H. pylori- and PMA-stimulated IL-8 levels compared with a negative control siRNA. MUC1-expressing AGS cells pretreated with the PPAR{$\gamma$} agonist troglitazone (TGN) had reduced H. pylori- and PMA-stimulated IL-8 levels compared with cells treated with H. pylori or PMA alone. However, following MUC1 siRNA knockdown, no differences in IL-8 levels were seen between TGN/H. pylori and H. pylori-only cells or between TGN/PMA and PMA-only cells. Finally, TGN-treated AGS cells had increased Muc1 promoter activity, as measured using a Muc1-luciferase reporter gene, and greater MUC1 protein levels by Western blot analysis, compared with vehicle controls. These results support the hypothesis that PPAR{$\gamma$} stimulates MUC1 expression by AGS cells, thereby attenuating H. pylori- and PMA-induced IL-8 production.},

TGF-beta1 inhibits Th1 development in part by suppressing the expression of T-bet, an IFN-gamma-induced transcription factor that promotes Th1 differentiation, but how TGF-beta1 suppresses T-bet is not known. In this study we show that TGF-beta1 suppresses IFN-gamma-induced T-bet expression through the hemopoietic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (Shp-1). In murine CD4+ T cells, IFN-gamma rapidly induced the expression of T-bet as well as of IFN regulatory factor-1, another transcription factor important for Th1 development. TGF-beta1 antagonized the effects of IFN-gamma, inhibiting IFN-gamma's induction of both Th1 transcription factors. In the presence of IFN-gamma, TGF-beta1 rapidly induced in Th cells the synthesis of the PTP Shp-1, but did not induce Shp-2 or several members of the suppressor of cytokine signaling family of Jak-Stat inhibitors. We tested the requirement for Shp-1 by using T cells from the Shp-1-deficient me(v)/me(v) mouse strain. Shp-1 was required for TGF-beta1's suppressive effects, because its suppression of T-bet and IFN regulatory factor-1 was completely abrogated in me(v)/me(v) CD4+ T cells. Receptor-proximal responses to IFN-gamma, such as the induction of Jak-Stat phosphorylation, were inhibited by TGF-beta1 in wild-type T cells, but not in me(v)/me(v) T cells. Consistent with a direct role for Shp-1, TGF-beta1's inhibition of IFN-gamma-induced Stat1 phosphorylation was sensitive to the general PTP inhibitor pervanadate. Together, these data show that TGF-beta1 suppresses IFN-gamma signaling and transcriptional responses in CD4+ T cells through the PTP Shp-1.},

By Gram-staining two sites, fundus and antrum, the sensitivity of the Gram stain for identifying a positive specimen increased from 91 to 100\%. Gram stain may be the preferred technique for rapid diagnosis. When cultured, C. pylori was recovered most often on modified Thayer-Martin medium incubated microaerophilically at 35 degrees C.

  abstract = {Since the discovery of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in 1983, numerous detection methods for the presence of the bacterium have been developed. Each one of them has been associated with advantages and disadvantages. Noninvasive tests such as serology, (13)C urea breath test (UBT) and stool antigen tests are usually preferred by the clinicians. Serology has its own limitation especially in endemic areas while (13)C UBT is technically very demanding. The stool antigen detection method, although specific, is usually associated with poor sensitivity. The (13)C UBT is believed to be specific, but with present revelation of the fact that stomach is colonized by many other urease producing bacteria makes it questionable. Histology, culture, rapid urease test and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are the tests which are carried out on antral biopsies collected by invasive means. Histology has been proposed to be very sensitive and specific but the question is how by simply looking the morphology of the bacteria in the microscope, one can claim that the curved bacterium is exclusively H. pylori. Rapid urease test (RUT), the doctor's test, is also challenged because the presence of other urease producing bacteria in the stomach cannot be denied. Moreover, RUT has been reported with poor sensitivity specially, when density of the bacterium is low. Isolation of H. pylori is essential to investigate its growth requirements, antibiotic susceptibility testing, studying virulence factor to develop vaccine and many more explorations. It has also got several disadvantages i.e., special condition for transporting, media, incubation and few days waiting for the colonies to appear, apart from the speed essentially needed to process the specimens. Till date, majority of the microbiological laboratories in the world are not equipped and trained to isolate such fastidious bacterium. The option left is PCR methods to detect H. pylori's DNA in gastric mucosa, gastric juice, saliva, dental plaques and environmental specimens. There are speculations for false positivity due to detection of non-pylori Helicobacters due to genetic sharing; and false negativity due to low bacterial counts and presence of PCR inhibitors. However, specimen collection, transportation and processing do not require speed and special conditions. PCR based diagnosis may be considered as gold standard by designing primers extremely specific to H. pylori and targeting at least more than one conserved genes. Similarly specificity of PCR may be improved by use of internal Primers. Further, nested PCR will take care of false negatives by countering the effect of PCR inhibitors and low bacterial counts. Therefore, nested PCR based methods if performed properly, may be proposed as gold standard test.},

Interestingly, data showing microdiversity of the H. pylori strains within a particular gastric niche remained scarce. To understand the extent of genetic diversity among H. pylori strains within a given host, 30 patients with gastro-duodenal problems were subjected to endoscopy and from each patient 10 single colonies were isolated. Characterization of each of these 10 single colonies by DNA fingerprinting as well as genotyping of several important genetic markers viz. cagA, vacA, iceA, vapD, cag PAI empty site, IS605, RFLP and two other genetic segments within cag PAI revealed that all of the 30 patients were infected with more than one strain and sometimes strains with 5 to 6 types of genetic variants. Analyses of certain genetic loci showed the microdiversity among the colonies from single patient, which may be due to the recombination events during long-term carriage of the pathogen. These results suggest that most of the patients have acquired H. pylori due to repeated exposure to this pathogen with different genetic make-up, which may increase the possibility of super infections. Genetic exchanges between these unrelated H. pylori strains may support certain H. pylori variant to grow better in a given host than the parental strain and thereby increasing the possibility for the severity of the infection.},

Biopsy specimens were studied by histology, culture, and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Oligonucleotide primers specific for H. pylori (16S rRNA, ureA, and cagA) were used to detect bacterial mRNA in gastric biopsy specimens. PCR was performed on DNA from corresponding H. pylori isolates to detect genomic 16S rRNA, ureA, and cagA. Of the 42 patients from whom clinical specimens were obtained, 25 were infected with H. pylori on the basis of both serology and histology or culture (i.e., tissue positive); 13 were negative by serology, histology, and culture; and 4 were positive by serology only. RT-PCR with 16S rRNA primers detected 24 of 25 tissue-positive and 0 of 17 tissue-negative patients (P {$<$} 0.001).

PCR of genomic DNA for the presence of the cagA gene in the corresponding bacterial isolates correlated absolutely with cagA gene expression in gastric tissue. These results indicate that RT-PCR is a sensitive and specific method for the detection of the presence of H. pylori and the expression of H. pylori genes in human gastric tissue.

  abstract = {We used a sensitive method based on tetramers of peptide and major histocompatibility complex II (pMHCII) to determine whether CD4(+) memory T cells resemble the T helper type 1 (T(H)1) and interleukin 17 (IL-17)-producing T helper (T(H)17) subsets described in vitro. Intravenous or intranasal infection with Listeria monocytogenes induced pMHCII-specific CD4(+) naive T cells to proliferate and produce effector cells, about 10\% of which resembled T(H)1 or T(H)17 cells, respectively. T(H)1 cells were also present among the memory cells that survived 3 months after infection, whereas T(H)17 cells disappeared. The short lifespan of T(H)17 cells was associated with small amounts of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, the IL-15 receptor and the receptor CD27, and little homeostatic proliferation. These results suggest that T(H)1 cells induced by intravenous infection are more efficient at entering the memory pool than are T(H)17 cells induced by intranasal infection.},

  abstract = {Accurate and rapid protein quantitation is essential for screening biomarkers for disease stratification and monitoring, and to validate the hundreds of putative markers in human biofluids, including blood plasma. An analytical method that utilizes stable isotope-labeled standard (SIS) peptides and selected/multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (SRM/MRM-MS) has emerged as a promising technique for determining protein concentrations. This targeted approach has analytical merit, but its true potential (in terms of sensitivity and multiplexing) has yet to be realized. Described herein is a method that extends the multiplexing ability of the MRM method to enable the quantitation 142 high-to-moderate abundance proteins (from 31mg/mL to 44ng/mL) in undepleted and non-enriched human plasma in a single run. The proteins have been reported to be associated to a wide variety of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), from cardiovascular disease (CVD) to diabetes. The concentrations of these proteins in human plasma are inferred from interference-free peptides functioning as molecular surrogates (2 peptides per protein, on average). A revised data analysis strategy, involving the linear regression equation of normal control plasma, has been instituted to enable the facile application to patient samples, as demonstrated in separate nutrigenomics and CVD studies. The exceptional robustness of the LC/MS platform and the quantitative method, as well as its high throughput, makes the assay suitable for application to patient samples for the verification of a condensed or complete protein panel.

  abstract = {Accumulation and deposition of \ss -amyloid peptide, a major constituent in neuritic plaques are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related neurodegenerative diseases. \ss -Amyloid (A\ss ) is derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein present in three major isoforms in brain comprising 695, 751 and 770 amino acids, respectively. Among other post-translational modifications, APP is modified during maturation by N- and O- glycosylation, which are thought to be responsible for its expression and secretion. Unlike N-glycosylation, no sites of O-glycosylation of APP have previously been reported. We report here the identification of three specific O-glycosylation sites of the secreted APP695 (sAPP695) produced in CHO cells, using a combination of high performance liquid chromatography and electrospray - tandem mass spectrometry. With the use of electron transfer dissociation and collision induced dissociation (ETD and CID), we identified type, composition and structures of the Core 1 type O-linked glycans attached at the residues: Thr 291, Thr 292 and Thr 576 of the full length APP695. The glycosylations comprise multiple short glycans, containing N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc), Gal-GalNAc and sialic acid terminated structures. The presence of the glycopeptides in the tryptic mixture was identified using the CID-generated sugar oxonium ions. ETD proved to be valuable for the unambiguous identification of the modified sites as ETD fragmentation occurred along the peptide backbone with little or no cleavage of the glycans. Thus, the combination of the CID and ETD techniques in LC-MS is shown here, as a powerful tool for de novo identification of O-glycosylations at unknown modification sites in proteins.},

Some are invasive and some are noninvasive. This study demonstrates the use of BACTEC\texttrademark{} FX system for the growth and diagnosis of H. pylori isolated from gastric biopsy specimens, cut and placed in blood culture bottles, with subsequent incubation in the apparatus. Twenty-five positive and 15 negative biopsy samples tested using the quick urease technique, CUTest\textregistered, were collected from 40 patients with confirmed chronic gastric inflammation. The biopsy samples were manually cut using a sterile scalpel and placed in tubes containing 5~ml of fetal bovine serum. The resulting suspensions were transferred using a syringe into anaerobic blood culture bottles. These bottles were incubated at 35~\textdegree C for a period of 7~days in the BACTEC\texttrademark{} FX system. All biopsy samples that reacted positive to the CUTest\textregistered{} and one biopsy sample that reacted negative to the CUTest\textregistered{} were confirmed as positive by the BACTEC\texttrademark{} FX system. In addition, there was a correlation between the positive culture and histology examination results. The use of BACTEC\texttrademark{} FX system significantly shortens the time needed for culturing, which makes the system more efficient in the identification of H. pylori. It should be emphasized that performing microbial culture testing has a significant role in monitoring antibiotic resistance, which cannot be done using other existing methods for H. pylori diagnosis.},

Technologies now exist to measure the abundance of many transcripts in parallel. The selection of the optimal reference gene for the normalisation of this data is a recurring problem, and several algorithms have been developed in order to solve it. So far nothing in R exists to unite these methods, together with other functions to read in and normalise the data using the chosen reference gene(s). Results We have developed two R/Bioconductor packages, ReadqPCR and NormqPCR, intended for a user with some experience with high-throughput data analysis using R, who wishes to use R to analyse RT-qPCR data. We illustrate their potential use in a workflow analysing a generic RT-qPCR experiment, and apply this to a real dataset.

  abstract = {CD8+ T cells are central to the eradication of intracellular pathogens, but they can also act to limit inflammation and immunopathology. During primary respiratory viral infection CD8+ effector T cells release the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10, which is essential for host survival. Here we report that CD8+ T-cell-derived IL-10 is absent in a recall response. We show in mice that the lack of IL-10 is due to a persistent loss of IL-27 responsiveness in CD8+ memory T cells, caused by down-regulation of the common cytokine receptor, glycoprotein 130. CD8+ memory T cells secreted less IL-10 when activated in the presence of IL-27 than did na\"ive controls, and retroviral expression of glycoprotein 130 restored IL-10 and reduced IFN-{$\gamma$} production upon restimulation. We demonstrate that human CD8+ memory cells are also characterized by impaired IL-27 responsiveness. Our data suggest that CD8+ T-cell activation involves a persistent loss of specific cytokine receptors that determines the functional potential of these cells during rechallenge infection.},

Increased airway hyper-responsiveness and airway inflammation are well documented in endurance athletes and endurance exercise is considered a major risk factor for asthma in elite athletes. Yet, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still to be deduced. We studied the effect of strenuous endurance exercise (marathon and half-ironman triathlon) on CD4+ lymphocyte sub-populations and on the balance between effector and regulatory CD4+ lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of trained athletes, Endurance exercise induced a significant increase in Th17 cells and a sustained decrease in peripheral blood regulatory T cells (Tregs). While interleukin (IL)-2 levels remained undetectable, post-race serum IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF) {$\beta$} levels were significantly elevated. Treg levels in sedentary controls' decreased in vitro after incubation with athletes' post-exercise serum, an effect that was attenuated by supplements of IL-2 or anti IL-6 neutralizing antibodies. Our data suggest that exercise-induced changes in serum cytokine levels promote alterations in Tregs and Th17 cell populations, which may divert the subtle balance in the immune system towards inflammation. This may explain allergic and autoimmune phenomena previously reported in endurance athletes and contribute to our understanding of exercise-related asthma.},

We explored the hypothesis that H. pylori contributes to the control of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We first examined M. tuberculosis-specific IFN-gamma and H. pylori antibody responses in 339 healthy Northern Californians undergoing routine tuberculin skin testing. Of 97 subjects (29\%) meeting criteria for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI), 45 (46\%) were H. pylori seropositive. Subjects with LTBI who were H. pylori-seropositive had 1.5-fold higher TB antigen-induced IFN-gamma responses (p = 0.04, ANOVA), and a more Th-1 like cytokine profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, compared to those who were H. pylori seronegative. To explore an association between H. pylori infection and clinical outcome of TB exposure, we evaluated H. pylori seroprevalence in baseline samples from two high risk TB case-contact cohorts, and from cynomolgus macaques experimentally challenged with M. tuberculosis. Compared to 513 household contacts who did not progress to active disease during a median 24 months follow-up, 120 prevalent TB cases were significantly less likely to be H. pylori infected (AOR: 0.55, 95\% CI 0.0.36-0.83, p = 0.005), though seroprevalence was not significantly different from non-progressors in 37 incident TB cases (AOR: 1.35 [95\% CI 0.63-2.9] p = 0.44). Cynomolgus macaques with natural H. pylori infection were significantly less likely to progress to TB 6 to 8 months after M. tuberculosis challenge (RR: 0.31 [95\% CI 0.12-0.80], p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: H. pylori infection may induce bystander effects that modify the risk of active TB in humans and non-human primates. That immunity to TB may be enhanced by exposure to other microbial agents may have important implications for vaccine development and disease control.},

  abstract = {Cell surface and extracellular proteins are O-glycosylated, where the most abundant type of O-glycosylation in proteins is the GalNAc attachment to serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr) in the protein chain by an a-glycosidic linkage. Most eukaryotic nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins modified by a-linked O-GlcNAc to Ser or Thr exhibit reciprocal O-GlcNAc glycosylation and phosphorylation during the cell cycle, cell stimulation, and/or cell growth. Less-investigated types of O-glycosylation are O-fucosylation, O-mannosylation, and O-glucosylation, but they are functionally of high relevance for early stages of development and for vital physiological functions of proteins. Glycosaminoglycans are a-linked to proteoglycans via a xylose-containing tetrasaccharide, represented by linear chains of repetitive disaccharides modified by carboxylates and O- or/and N-linked sulfates. Analysis of O-glycosylation by mass spectrometry (MS) is a complex task due to the high structural diversity of glycan and protein factors. The parameters in structural analysis of O-glycans include determination of (i) O-glycosylation attachment sites in the protein sequence, (ii) the type of attached monosaccharide moiety, (iii) a core type in the case of GalNAc O-glycosylation, (iv) the type and size of the oligosaccharide portion, (v) carbohydrate branching patterns, (vi) the site of monosaccharide glycosidic linkages, (vii) the anomericity of glycosidic linkages, and (viii) covalent modifications of the sugar backbone chains by carbohydrate- and noncarbohydrate-type of substitutents. Classical and novel analytical strategies for identification and sequencing of O-glycans by MS are described. These include methods to analyze O-glycans after total or partial release from the parent protein by chemical or enzymatic approach or to analyze O-glycosylated peptides by mapping and sequencing from proteolytic mixtures. A recombination process of multiply charged glycopeptides with electrons by electron capture dissociation Fourier transform ion cyclotrone resonance (FTICR)-MS has been introduced and is instrumental for nonergodic polypeptide backbone cleavages without losses of labile glycan substituents. A method for O-glycoscreening under increased sensitivity and efficient sequencing as a combination of an on-line coupling of capillary electrophoresis separation, as well as an automated MS-tandem MS (MS/MS) switching under variable energy conditions collision-induced dissociation (CID) protocol, is beneficial for determination of O-acetylation and oversulfation (Bindila et al., 2004a; Zamfir et al., 2004a). O-glycomics by robotized chip-electrospray/ionization (ESI)-MS and MS/MS on the quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) and FTICR analyzers, accurate mass determination, and software for assignment of fragmentation spectra represent essentials for high-throughput (HTP) in serial screenings (Bindila et al., 2004b; Froesch et al., 2004; Vakhrushev et al., 2005). Dimerization of intact O-glycosylated proteins can be investigated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)-MS after blotting.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To investigate variation within the cag pathogenicity island (PAI) of Helicobacter pylori isolated from patients with dyspepsia in mid-Essex, and to evaluate the effect on expression of anti-CagA antibody. METHODS: Sixty two isolates of H pylori cultured from gastric biopsies were screened by specific PCR assays for the presence of cagA and other gene markers (cagD and cagE, and virD4) in the cag PAI. An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Viva Diagnostica helicobacter p120) was used to test for anti-CagA IgG antibody in matching sera. Isolates were also genotyped by vacuolating cytotoxin polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, and tested for absence of the complete cag PAI (empty site PCR assay). RESULTS: Forty one of the H pylori isolates had a cag PAI containing cagA. One strain had no cagA but other cag PAI loci were present, whereas the remaining 20 strains had no detectable cag PAI markers. Anti-CagA IgG antibody was detected in 34 sera by the ELISA assay, and when compared with the cag PAI genotype of the infecting strain, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 92\%, 87\%, and 100\%, respectively. The seven discrepant or borderline strains in the ELISA were all vacA s1 but differed in other genotypic markers. CONCLUSIONS: The cag PAI was widely distributed in H pylori from patients with dyspepsia in mid-Essex who had different gastric pathologies. Infection with a strain having an uninterrupted cag PAI was associated with the presence of anti-CagA antibody in most patients. Discrepant ELISA results, mostly for elderly patients with duodenal ulcers, were attributed to cagA associated variation, particularly to the presence of mixed cagA+/cagA- cell variants in the infecting strain population. Tests for anti-CagA serum antibody were unreliable for predicting severity of clinical disease associated with H pylori infection in this series of patients.},

IL-12 triggers Th1 polarization of naive CD4+ T cells and secretion of IFN-{$\gamma$}. We describe a new heterodimeric cytokine termed IL-27 that consists of EBI3, an IL-12p40-related protein, and p28, a newly discovered IL-12p35-related polypeptide. IL-27 is an early product of activated antigen-presenting cells and drives rapid clonal expansion of naive but not memory CD4+ T cells. It also strongly synergizes with IL-12 to trigger IFN-{$\gamma$} production of naive CD4+ T cells. IL-27 mediates its biologic effects through the orphan cytokine receptor WSX-1/TCCR.},

  abstract = {The recently discovered cytokine IL-27 belongs to the IL-6/IL-12 family of cytokines and induced proliferation of naive CD4+ T cells and the generation of a Th1-type adaptive immune response. Although binding of IL-27 to the cytokine receptor WSX-1 was demonstrated, this interaction proved insufficient to mediate cellular effects. Hence, IL-27 was believed to form a heteromeric signaling receptor complex with WSX-1 and another, yet to be identified, cytokine receptor subunit. In this study, we describe that WSX-1 together with gp130 constitutes a functional signal-transducing receptor for IL-27. We show that neither of the two subunits itself is sufficient to mediate IL-27-induced signal transduction, but that the combination of both is required for this event. Expression analysis of WSX-1 and gp130 by quantitative PCR suggests that IL-27 might have a variety of cellular targets besides naive CD4+ T cells: we demonstrate gene induction of a subset of inflammatory cytokines in primary human mast cells and monocytes in response to IL-27 stimulation. Thus, IL-27 not only contributes to the development of an adaptive immune response through its action on CD4+ T cells, it also directly acts on cells of the innate immune system.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori, the causative agent of type B gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric adenocarcinoma and MALT lymphoma, uses the Cag type IV secretion system to induce a strong proinflammatory response in the gastric mucosa and to inject its effector protein CagA into gastric cells. CagA translocation results in altered host cell gene expression profiles and cytoskeletal rearrangements, and it is considered as a major bacterial virulence trait. Recently, it has been shown that binding of the type IV secretion apparatus to integrin receptors on target cells is a crucial step in the translocation process. Several bacterial proteins, including the Cag-specific components CagL and CagI, have been involved in this interaction. Here, we have examined the localization and interactions of CagI in the bacterial cell. Since the cagI gene overlaps and is co-transcribed with the cagL gene, the role of CagI for type IV secretion system function has been difficult to assess, and conflicting results have been reported regarding its involvement in the proinflammatory response. Using a marker-free gene deletion approach and genetic complementation, we show now that CagI is an essential component of the Cag type IV secretion apparatus for both CagA translocation and interleukin-8 induction. CagI is distributed over soluble and membrane-associated pools and seems to be partly surface-exposed. Deletion of several genes encoding essential Cag components has an impact on protein levels of CagI and CagL, suggesting that both proteins require partial assembly of the secretion apparatus. Finally, we show by co-immunoprecipitation that CagI and CagL interact with each other. Taken together, our results indicate that CagI and CagL form a functional complex which is formed at a late stage of secretion apparatus assembly.},

These two layers exhibit different gastroprotective roles; therefore, individual regulation of thickness and mucin composition were studied. Mucus thickness was measured in vivo with micropipettes in anesthetized mice [isoflurane; C57BL/6, Muc1-/-, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-/-, and neuronal NOS (nNOS)-/-] and rats (inactin) after surgical exposure of the gastric mucosa. The two mucus layers covering the gastric mucosa were differently regulated. Luminal administration of PGE(2) increased the thickness of both layers, whereas luminal NO stimulated only firmly adherent mucus accumulation. A new gastroprotective role for iNOS was indicated since iNOS-deficient mice had thinner firmly adherent mucus layers and a lower mucus accumulation rate, whereas nNOS did not appear to be involved in mucus secretion. Downregulation of gastric mucus accumulation was observed in Muc1-/- mice. Both the firmly and loosely adherent mucus layers consisted of Muc5ac mucins. In conclusion, this study showed that, even though both the two mucus layers covering the gastric mucosa consist of Muc5ac, they are differently regulated by luminal PGE(2) and NO. A new gastroprotective role for iNOS was indicated since iNOS-/- mice had a thinner firmly adherent mucus layer. In addition, a regulatory role of Muc1 was demonstrated since downregulation of gastric mucus accumulation was observed in Muc1-/- mice.},

Over a period of 5 months, mucosal antral biopsy specimens were obtained from 222 consecutive dyspeptic patients undergoing endoscopy. Biopsy samples were plated in parallel on all eight media. Egg yolk emulsion agar (EYE), Skirrow's medium, Dent's medium, and modified Thayer-Martin medium were used as selective media; modified chocolate agar (MCHOC), Triptycase soy agar (TSA), brucella agar, and brain heart infusion agar were used as nonselective media. Overall, by using these eight media, H. pylori was recovered from biopsy specimens from 114 of 222 patients, yielding an isolation rate of 51\%. Comparison of all possible combinations of the eight media showed that the highest rate of isolation of H. pylori was 100\% (114 of 114) with EYE-MCHOC, followed by 96.5\% (110 of 114) when EYE-TSA was used. Conversely, it was found that none of the media used alone yielded a 100\% rate of recovery (the maximum recovery rate was 95\%, which was achieved with EYE). These results indicate that the association of EYE and MCHOC yielded the maximum recovery of H. pylori from gastric biopsy specimens. Therefore, the use of selective and nonselective media in parallel offers optimal recovery rates with only a slight increase in costs.},

The H. pylori neutrophil-activating protein (HP-NAP) activates PMNs, monocytes, and mast cells, and promotes PMN adherence to the endothelium in vitro. By using intravital microscopy analysis of rat mesenteric venules exposed to HP-NAP, we demonstrated, for the first time in vivo, that HP-NAP efficiently crosses the endothelium and promotes a rapid PMN adhesion. This HP-NAP-induced adhesion depends on the acquisition of a high affinity state of beta(2) integrin on the plasma membrane of PMNs, and this conformational change requires a functional p38 MAPK. We also show that HP-NAP stimulates human PMNs to synthesize and release a number of chemokines, including CXCL8, CCL3, and CCL4. Collectively, these data strongly support a central role for HP-NAP in the inflammation process in vivo: indeed, HP-NAP not only recruits leukocytes from the vascular lumen, but also stimulates them to produce messengers that may contribute to the maintenance of the flogosis associated with the H. pylori infection.},

  abstract = {Infections with the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) can lead to severe gastric diseases ranging from chronic gastritis and ulceration to neoplastic changes in the stomach. Development and progress of H. pylori-associated disorders are determined by multifarious bacterial factors. Many of them interact directly with host cells or require specific receptors, while others enter the host cytoplasm to derail cellular functions. Several adhesins (e.g. BabA, SabA, AlpA/B, or OipA) establish close contact with the gastric epithelium as an important first step in persistent colonization. Soluble H. pylori factors (e.g. urease, VacA, or HtrA) have been suggested to alter cell survival and intercellular adhesions. Via a type IV secretion system (T4SS), H. pylori also translocates the effector cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and peptidoglycan directly into the host cytoplasm, where cancer- and inflammation-associated signal transduction pathways can be deregulated. Through these manifold possibilities of interaction with host cells, H. pylori interferes with the complex signal transduction networks in its host and mediates a multi-step pathogenesis.},

IL-27-driven c-Maf expression transactivates IL-21 production, which acts as an autocrine growth factor for the expansion and/or maintenance of IL-27-induced Tr1 cells. ICOS further promotes IL-27-driven Tr1 cells.

Here we report the presence of helicobacter in commercially bred mice supposedly free of this infection. Furthermore, three out of six different commercial laboratories performing helicobacter testing on the same spiked faecal samples failed to detect and identify H. hepaticus. We designed a simple generic PCR assay that amplifies a 261bp amplicon spanning two of the seven variable regions in the 16S rRNA of helicobacter. Using this assay together with an established generic assay designed by Bohr [Bohr, U.R., Primus, A., Zagoura, A., Glasbrenner, B., Wex, T., Malfertheiner, P., 2002. A group-specific PCR assay for the detection of Helicobacteraceae in human gut.

We think these assays together could detect all the currently known species of helicobacter and hopefully the new ones as well. In addition, we have been able to identify different species of helicobacter and their relative proportions infecting a single animal. This information has also shown that some helicobacters may have a much broader host range than originally reported.},

PTM at multiple sites on a protein creates a combinatorial explosion in the number of potential 'mod-forms', or global patterns of modification. Distinct mod-forms can elicit distinct downstream responses, so that the overall response depends partly on the effectiveness of a particular mod-form to elicit a response and partly on the stoichiometry of that mod-form in the molecular population. We introduce the 'mod-form distribution'-the relative stoichiometries of each mod-form-as the most informative measure of a protein's state. Distinct mod-form distributions may summarize information about distinct cellular and physiological conditions and allow downstream processes to interpret this information accordingly. Such information 'encoding' by PTMs may facilitate evolution by weakening the need to directly link upstream conditions to downstream responses. Mod-form distributions provide a quantitative framework in which to interpret ideas of 'PTM codes' that are emerging in several areas of biology, as we show by reviewing examples of ion channels, GPCRs, microtubules, and transcriptional co-regulators. We focus particularly on examples other than the well-known 'histone code', to emphasize the pervasive use of information encoding in molecular biology.

Using expression cloning techniques, we have recently identified an additional IL-12-binding protein subunit, IL-12R beta 2, which binds 125I-huIL-12 with a Kd of about 5 nM when expressed alone in COS-7 cells. Coexpression of IL-12R beta 1 and IL-12R beta 2 in COS-7 cells results in formation of two classes of 125 I-huIL-12-binding sites with Kds of about 50 pM and 5 nM. Mouse IL-12 p40 subunit homodimer (mo(p40)2) blocked 125I-huIL-12 binding to human IL-12R beta 1, but did not inhibit binding to human IL-12R beta 2. In contrast, anti-huIL-12 monoclonal antibody 20C2, which does not block 125I-huIL-12 binding to human IL-12R beta 1, completely blocked binding to human IL-12R beta 2. These results demonstrate that two classes of IL-12 inhibitors, one that primarily blocks IL-12/IL-12R beta 1 interaction (e.g., mo(p40)2), and one that primarily blocks IL-12/IL-12R beta 2 interaction (e.g., 20C2), can be identified.},

  abstract = {We have identified a cDNA from a human phytohemagglutinin-activated  lymphoblast library encoding a protein that binds  125I-labeled human interleukin 12  (125I-huIL-12) with a Kd of  about 5 nM when expressed in COS-7 cells. When coexpressed in COS-7  cells with the previously identified IL-12 {$\beta$} receptor (IL-12R{$\beta$})  protein, two classes of 125I-huIL-12 binding sites were  measured with Kds of about 55 pM and 8 nM,  corresponding to the high- and low-affinity binding sites seen on  phytohemagglutinin-activated lymphoblasts. This newly identified  huIL-12R subunit is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, with  closest resemblance to the {$\beta$}-type cytokine receptor gp130 and the  receptors for leukemia inhibitory factor and granulocyte  colony-stimulating factor. Consequently, we have reclassified the  previously identified IL-12R{$\beta$} subunit as huIL-12R{$\beta$}1 and designated  the newly identified subunit as huIL-12R{$\beta$}2. huIL-12R{$\beta$}2 is an  862-amino acid type I transmembrane protein with a 595-amino-acid-long  extracellular domain and a cytoplasmic tail of 216 amino acids that  contains three tyrosine residues. A cDNA encoding the mouse homolog of  the huIL12R{$\beta$}2 protein has also been isolated. Human and mouse  IL-12R{$\beta$}2 proteins show a 68\% amino acid sequence identity. When  expressed in COS-7 cells, huIL-12R{$\beta$}2 exists as a disulfide-linked  oligomer with an apparent monomeric molecular weight of 130 kDa.  Coexpression of the two identified IL-12R subunits in Ba/F3 cells  conferred IL-12 responsiveness, and clones of these cotransfected  Ba/F3 cells that grew continuously in the presence of IL-12 were  isolated and designated LJM-1 cells. LJM-1 cells exhibited  dose-dependent proliferation in response to huIL-12, with an  ED50 of about 1 pM huIL-12. Interestingly, Ba/F3 cells  transfected with IL-12R{$\beta$}2 alone proliferated in response to huIL-12  with an ED50 of about 50 pM, although a role for  endogenous mouse IL-12R{$\beta$}1 in IL-12 signal transduction in  these transfectants cannot be ruled out. These results demonstrate that  the functional high-affinity IL-12R is composed of at least two  {$\beta$}-type cytokine receptor subunits, each independently exhibiting a  low affinity for IL-12.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have lower prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection, but the exact reason for this is not yet clear. AIM: To examine whether the antibiotics frequently used in inflammatory bowel disease are responsible for the lower prevalence of H. pylori infection. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on prolonged previous antibiotic therapy were used for comparison. METHODS: Presence/absence of H. pylori infection was detected by a (13)C-urea breath test in 133 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (82 ulcerative colitis, and 51 Crohn's disease) and compared with that of 135 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and with two age-matched control groups (200 patients each). Primary disease location, duration of disease and detailed analysis of previous and current medication (dose and duration of antibiotics, steroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid) were analysed in each cases. RESULTS: Seventeen of the 133 patients with inflammatory bowel disease [12.2\% (10/82) of ulcerative colitis and 13.7\% (7/51) of Crohn's disease] and 90/135 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (66.7\%) were positive for H. pylori. A total of 78/200 (39\%) for the inflammatory-bowel-disease-group-matched controls and 110/210 (55\%) for the chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-matched controls were positive for H. pylori. The history of any antibiotic or steroid therapy had no influence on H. pylori status of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of H. pylori compared to the age-matched controls is significantly lower in patients with inflammatory bowel disease but not in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Antibiotic use is not responsible for the lower prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Today, when more than 60\% of animal diseases are zoonotic, understanding their origin and development and identifying protective immune responses in ruminants are major challenges. Robust, efficient and cost-effective tools are preconditions to solve these challenges. Cytokines play a key role in the main mechanisms by which the immune system is balanced in response to infectious pathogens. The cytokine balance has thus become the focus of research to characterize immune response in ruminants. Currently, SYBR Green reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is the most widely method used to investigate cytokine gene expression in ruminants, but the conditions in which the many assays are carried out vary considerably and need to be properly evaluated. Accordingly, the quantification of gene expression by RT-qPCR requires normalization by multiple reference genes. The objective of the present study was thus to develop an RT-qPCR assay to simultaneously quantify the expression of several cytokines and reference genes in three ruminant species. In this paper, we detail each stage of the experimental protocol, check validation parameters and report assay performances, following MIQE guidelines. RESULTS: Ten novel primer sets were designed to quantify five cytokine genes (IL-4, IL-10, IL-12B, IFN-{$\gamma$} and TNF-{$\alpha$}) and five reference genes (ACTB, GAPDH, H3F3A, PPIA and YWHAZ) in cattle, sheep, and goats. All the primer sets were designed to span exon-exon boundaries and use the same hybridization temperature. Each stage of the RT-qPCR method was detailed; their specificity and efficiency checked, proved and are reported here, demonstrating the reproducibility of our method, which is capable of detecting low levels of cytokine mRNA up to one copy whatever the species. Finally, we checked the stability of candidate reference gene expression, performed absolute quantification of cytokine and reference gene mRNA in whole blood samples and relative expression of cytokine mRNA in stimulated PBMC samples. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a novel RT-qPCR assay for the simultaneous relative quantification of five major cytokines in cattle, sheep and goats, and their accurate normalization by five reference genes. This accurate and easily reproducible tool can be used to investigate ruminant immune responses and is widely accessible to the veterinary research community.},

We successfully detected H. hepaticus and H. bilis in the liver, cecum and feces of experimentally infected mice. H. pylori was successfully detected in the feces samples from 3 patients infected with H. pylori while not in the feces samples from 3 healthy human. However, the C97/C05-C97/C98 PCR assay detected H. pylori in the 2 positive samples.

An unconditional multiple logistical regression model was performed to determine the association between IL-17A and IL-17F genetic variations and gastric cancer risk. Unconditional logistic regression analysis showed that subjects carrying the rs2275913AA and rs3748067 TT genotypes were 1.70 and 3.45 times more likely to develop gastric cancer. Furthermore, rs2275913 and rs3748067 genetic variants significantly interacted with H. pylori infection on the risk of gastric cancer. The interaction between rs3748067 and rs9382084 genetic variants and tobacco smoking trend was significant. In addition, rs2275913, rs3748067 and rs9382084 genetic variants were only associated with non-cardia gastric cancer. The findings suggest that the rs2275913, rs3748067 and rs9382084 polymorphisms increase the risk of gastric cancer, and they interact with H. pylori infection, tobacco smoking and subsites of gastric cancer. These findings could be helpful in identifying individuals at increased risk for developing gastric cancer.},

Polarization of macrophages is a characteristic of both cancer and infection, and may promote progression or resolution of disease. However, the role of macrophages and their polarization during H. pylori infection has not been well defined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By using a mouse model of infection and gastric biopsies from 29 individuals, we have analyzed macrophage recruitment and polarization during H. pylori infection by flow cytometry and real-time PCR. We found a sequential recruitment of neutrophils, eosinophils and macrophages to the gastric mucosa of infected mice. Gene expression analysis of stomach tissue and sorted macrophages revealed that gastric macrophages were polarized to M1 after H. pylori infection, and this process was substantially accelerated by prior vaccination. Human H. pylori infection was characterized by a mixed M1/M2 polarization of macrophages. However, in H. pylori-associated atrophic gastritis, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase was markedly increased compared to uncomplicated gastritis, indicative of an enhanced M1 macrophage polarization in this pre-malignant lesion. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results show that vaccination of mice against H. pylori amplifies M1 polarization of gastric macrophages, and that a similar enhanced M1 polarization is present in human H. pylori-induced atrophic gastritis.},

Although T(reg) cell dysfunction and/or T(H)17 cell dysregulation are thought to contribute to the development of autoimmune disorders, little is known about the physiological pathways that control the generation of these cell lineages. Here we report the identification of the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) as a regulator of T(reg) and T(H)17 cell differentiation in mice. AHR activation by its ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin induced functional T(reg) cells that suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. On the other hand, AHR activation by 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole interfered with T(reg) cell development, boosted T(H)17 cell differentiation and increased the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. Thus, AHR regulates both T(reg) and T(H)17 cell differentiation in a ligand-specific fashion, constituting a unique target for therapeutic immunomodulation.},

It is unclear why the immune system is unable to eliminate the infection, but recent studies suggested that CD4+/CD25+/Foxp3+ regulatory T cells may be involved in this process. METHODS: By using a mouse model of infection and gastric biopsies from 108 patients, we performed a detailed descriptive and functional characterization of the Helicobacter-induced CD25+/Foxp3+ T-cell response. RESULTS: In C57BL/6 mice, H pylori induced a marked gastric Foxp3+ T-cell response, which increased over several months together with the severity of inflammation, until a stable homeostatic situation became established. Accordingly, in Helicobacter-infected patients, but not in uninfected individuals, large numbers of gastric Foxp3+ T cells were detected immunohistochemically. To define the functional in vivo relevance of this response, CD25+ cells were depleted systemically in mice by using an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (PC61). Already 4 weeks after infection, PC61-treated mice, but not untreated animals, developed a severe gastritis with heightened cytokine expression and increased numbers of mucosal T cells, B cells, and macrophages. This was accompanied by increased titers of H pylori-specific IgG1 and IgG2c antibodies in the sera of PC61-treated mice. This increased gastric inflammatory response in CD25-depleted mice was associated with reduced bacterial loads. CONCLUSIONS: CD25+/Foxp3+ T cells actively participate in the immune response to H pylori. In vivo depletion of these cells in infected mice leads to increased gastric inflammation and reduced bacterial colonization.},

In a follow-up experiment, recombinant H. pylori catalase plus CT was used for immunization, and groups of mice were challenged with the Sydney strain of H. pylori. Immunization with recombinant catalase protected a significant proportion (9 of 10) of the mice from H. pylori challenge, indicating that this enzyme should be considered as a candidate for a future vaccine. This study provides the first available data on the efficacy of protective immunization with the new Sydney strain of H. pylori in a mouse model. These data also provide indirect evidence that proteins which are normally intracellular, such as catalase, may be present on the surface of H. pylori and thus may provide targets for immunization.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Helicobacter pylori infects half of the world's population, thereby causing significant human morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms by which professional antigen-presenting cells recognize the microbe are poorly understood. METHODS: Using dendritic cells (DCs) from TRIF, MyD88, TLR 2/4/7/9(-/-), and multiple double/triple/quadruple mutant mice, we characterized receptors and pathways mediating innate immune recognition of H pylori. RESULTS: We identified a MyD88-dependent component of the DC activation program, which was induced by surface TLRs, with TLR2 and to a minor extent also TLR4 being the exclusive surface receptors recognizing H pylori. A second MyD88-dependent component could be blocked in TLR2/4(-/-) DCs by inhibitors of endosomal acidification and depended on intracellular TLRs. We identified TLR9-mediated recognition of H pylori DNA as a principal H pylori-induced intracellular TLR pathway and further showed that H pylori RNA induces proinflammatory cytokines in a TLR-dependent manner. Microarray analysis showed complementary, redundant, and synergistic interactions between TLRs and additionally revealed gene expression patterns specific for individual TLRs, including a TLR2-dependent anti-inflammatory signature. A third component of the DC activation program was primarily composed of type I interferon-stimulated genes. This response was MyD88 and TRIF independent but was inducible by RIG-I-dependent recognition of H pylori RNA. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide novel comprehensive insights into the mechanisms of H pylori recognition by DCs. Understanding these processes provides a basis for the rational design of new vaccination strategies.},

However, the sensitivity and kinetics of diagnostic PCR may be dramatically reduced when applied directly to biological samples, such as blood and feces, owing to PCR-inhibitory components. As a result, pre-PCR processing procedures have been developed to remove or reduce the effects of PCR inhibitors. Pre-PCR processing comprises all steps prior to the detection of PCR products, that is, sampling, sample preparation, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) amplification. The aim of pre-PCR processing is to convert a complex biological sample with its target nucleic acids/cells into PCR-amplifiable samples by combining sample preparation and amplification conditions. Several different pre-PCR processing strategies are used: (1) optimization of the DNA amplification conditions by the use of alternative DNA polymerases and/or amplification facilitators, (2) optimization of the sample preparation method, (3) optimization of the sampling method, and (4) combinations of the different strategies. This review describes different pre-PCR processing strategies to circumvent PCR inhibition to allow accurate and precise DNA amplification.},

Effects of therapeutic immunization against H. pylori infection on the Treg function were also studied to better understand the mechanisms leading to postimmunization gastritis in these mice. Depletion of Treg led to extensive proliferation to H. pylori antigens of CD4+ T cells isolated from either na\"ive, H. pylori-infected or H. pylori-immunized mice. Using the Treg-depleted CD4+ T cells from immunized mice as effector cells, we compared the suppressive efficacy of Treg isolated from na\"ive, infected or immunized mice and found that Treg from na\"ive mice, and slightly less efficiently from infected mice, suppressed the CD25- effector T-cell response and in most cases were distinctly more efficacious than Treg isolated from immunized mice. The suppressive efficacy of Treg isolated from the differently treated mice correlated closely with production of interleukin-5 (IL-5) by the Treg and suppression of interferon-gamma and IL-2 production by the CD25- effector T cells. Our study is the first to demonstrate in H. pylori-induced chronic infection, antigen-specific Treg with differential efficacy in suppressing H. pylori proinflammatory T effector cells.},

  abstract = {Sublingual (SL) immunization has been described as an effective novel way to induce mucosal immune responses in the respiratory and genital tracts. We examined the potential of SL immunization against Helicobacter pylori to stimulate immune responses in the gastrointestinal mucosa and protect against H. pylori infection. Mice received two SL immunizations with H. pylori lysate antigens and cholera toxin as an adjuvant, and after challenge with live H. pylori bacteria, their immune responses and protection were evaluated, as were immune responses prior to challenge. SL immunization induced enhanced proliferative responses to H. pylori antigens in cervicomandibular lymph nodes and provided at least the same level of immune responses and protection as corresponding intragastric immunization. Protection in SL-immunized mice was associated with strong H. pylori-specific serum IgG and IgA antibody responses in the stomach and intestine, with strong proliferation and gamma interferon (IFN-{$\gamma$}) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) production by spleen and mesenteric lymph node T cells stimulated with H. pylori antigens in vitro, and with increased IFN-{$\gamma$} and IL-17 gene expression in the stomach compared to levels in infected unimmunized mice. Immunohistochemical studies showed enhanced infiltration of CD4(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cells into the H. pylori-infected stomach mucosa of SL-immunized but not unimmunized H. pylori-infected mice, which coincided with increased expression of the mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM-1) and T and B cell-attracting chemokines CXCL10 and CCL28. We conclude that, in mice, SL immunization can effectively induce protection against H. pylori infection in association with strong T and B cell infiltration into the stomach.},

  abstract = {Human neutrophil proteinases (elastase, proteinase-3, and cathepsin-G) are released at sites of acute inflammation. We hypothesized that these inflammation-associated proteinases can affect cell signaling by targeting proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR(2)). The PAR family of G protein-coupled receptors is triggered by a unique mechanism involving the proteolytic unmasking of an N-terminal self-activating tethered ligand (TL). Proteinases can either activate PAR signaling by unmasking the TL sequence or disarm the receptor for subsequent enzyme activation by cleaving downstream from the TL sequence. We found that none of neutrophil elastase, cathepsin-G, and proteinase-3 can activate G(q)-coupled PAR(2) calcium signaling; but all of these proteinases can disarm PAR(2), releasing the N-terminal TL sequence, thereby preventing G(q)-coupled PAR(2) signaling by trypsin. Interestingly, elastase (but neither cathepsin-G nor proteinase-3) causes a TL-independent PAR(2)-mediated activation of MAPK that, unlike the canonical trypsin activation, does not involve either receptor internalization or recruitment of {$\beta$}-arrestin. Cleavage of synthetic peptides derived from the extracellular N terminus of PAR(2), downstream of the TL sequence, demonstrated distinct proteolytic sites for all three neutrophil-derived enzymes. We conclude that in inflammation, neutrophil proteinases can modulate PAR(2) signaling by preventing/disarming the G(q)/calcium signal pathway and, via elastase, can selectively activate the p44/42 MAPK pathway. Our data illustrate a new mode of PAR regulation that involves biased PAR(2) signaling by neutrophil elastase and a disarming/silencing effect of cathepsin-G and proteinase-3.},

The human genome encodes 20 transferases; 17 of which have been characterized functionally. The complexity of the GalNAc-T family reflects the differential patterns of expression among the individual enzyme isoforms and the unique substrate specificities which are required to form the dense arrays of glycans that are essential for mucin function. We report the expression patterns and enzymatic activity of the remaining three members of the family and the further characterization of a recently reported isoform, GalNAc-T17. One isoform, GalNAcT-16 that is most homologous to GalNAc-T14, is widely expressed (abundantly in the heart) and has robust polypeptide transferase activity. The second isoform GalNAc-T18, most similar to GalNAc-T8, -T9 and -T19, completes a discrete subfamily of GalNAc-Ts. It is widely expressed and has low, albeit detectable, activity. The final isoform, GalNAc-T20, is most homologous to GalNAc-T11 but lacks a lectin domain and has no detectable transferase activity with the panel of substrates tested. We have also identified and characterized enzymatically active splice variants of GalNAc-T13 that differ in the sequence of their lectin domain. The variants differ in their affinities for glycopeptide substrates. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the complexities of mucin-type O-glycan formation and provide insight into the underlying mechanisms employed to heavily decorate mucins and mucin-like domains with carbohydrate.},

Here we investigate the basis for the loss of apical staining of the gastric foveolar epithelium in H. pylori gastritis. METHODS: MUC1 was examined in the gastric antrum from cases of H. pylori gastritis and normal controls. We used tissue sections that were either treated or not treated with periodate to effect deglycosylation, and the monoclonal antibodies LICRLonM8, MUSE-11, CT2 and BC2. RESULTS: We show that the epitopes on the TR domain of MUC1 are partially cryptic due to glycosylation and that MUC1 is present on the apical surface of the gastric foveolar epithelium of gastritis patients. CONCLUSION: This observation suggests that there is no substantial loss of the mucin domain of MUC1 from the apical surface in gastritis, as suggested by others, but rather the H. pylori influences the glycosylation of MUC1. This paper highlights the issue of epitope specificity of monoclonal antibodies directed against disease-associated markers, specifically when they are glycoproteins, as is the case for many cancer markers.},

Since the general prevalence of Helicobacter pylori has been decreasing, we hypothesized that H. pylori serostatus would be inversely related to the presence of asthma. METHODS: Adults were recruited to participate in the New York University (NYU)/Bellevue Asthma Registry in New York City. Adult asthma cases (N = 318) and controls (N = 208) were identified and serum IgG antibodies to H. pylori whole cell antigens or the immunodominant CagA antigen were measured. RESULTS: As expected, the asthma cases and controls differed with respect to atopy and lung function. Seropositivity to H. pylori or CagA antigen was present in 47.1\% of the total case and control study population. Asthma was inversely associated with CagA seropositivity (OR = 0.57, 95\% CI = 0.36-0.89). Median age of onset of asthma (doctor's diagnosis) was older (21 years) among individuals with CagA+ strains than among H. pylori- individuals (11 years) (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: These data are consistent with the hypothesis that colonization with CagA+ H. pylori strains is inversely associated with asthma and is associated with an older age of asthma onset in an urban population. The data suggest H. pylori as a marker for protection.},

HMFG1 stained the antrum foveolar cells and the body glands of normal gastric mucosa, whereas SM3 reactivity was restricted to the perinuclear region of some foveolar cells. Type I intestinal metaplasia exhibited down-regulation of MUC1 expression using both MAbs. Every gastric carcinoma was stained with HMFG1 and 80\% with SM3. High levels of expression of HMFG1 were associated with lymphatic invasion, nodal metastatization, and advanced pTNM staging. The expression of SM3 was associated with the histologic (solid) type of carcinoma, expanding growth pattern, wall penetration, lymphatic invasion and age of the patients. Despite a trend for a poor outcome in patients with tumours (over)expressing MUC1 mucin, the survival of the patients evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis was not significantly associated with the levels of expression of HMFG1 or with the expression of the SM3 epitope. We conclude that (a) MUC1 expression, namely of the SM3 cancer-associated epitope, is significantly associated with several aspects of gastric cancer development and progression; and (b) MUC1 expression should not be used as a prognostic marker in patients with gastric carcinoma.},

MAb CLH5 reacted exclusively with the MUC6 peptide and with native and deglycosylated mucin extracts from gastric tissues. MAb CLH5 immunoreactivity was observed in normal gastric mucosa restricted to pyloric glands of the antrum and mucopeptic cells of the neck zone of the body region. In a series of 104 gastric carcinomas, 31 (29.8\%) were immunoreactive for MUC6. The expression of MUC6 was not associated with histomorphological type or with clinicopathological features of the carcinomas. Analysis of the co-expression of MUC6 with other secreted mucins (MUC5AC and MUC2) in 20 gastric carcinomas revealed that different mucin core proteins are co-expressed in 55\% of the cases. MUC6 was co-expressed and co-localized with MUC5AC in 45\% and with MUC2 in 5\% of the cases. Expression of MUC2 alone was observed in 25\% of the cases. All carcinomas expressing MUC2 mucin in more than 50\% of the cells were of the mucinous type according to the WHO classification. The co-expression of mucins was independent of the histomorphological type and stage of the tumors. In conclusion, we observed, using a novel well-characterized MAb, that MUC6 is a good marker of mucopeptic cell differentiation and is expressed in 30\% of gastric carcinomas, independent of the clinicopathological features of the cases. Furthermore, we found that co-expression and co-localization of mucins in gastric carcinomas is independent of histomorphology and staging. Finally, we observed that intestinal mucin MUC2 is expressed as the most prominent mucin of the mucins tested in mucinous-type gastric carcinomas.},

Here, we demonstrate that activation of dendritic cells by TLR2 or TLR4 agonists, although it led to comparable activation of NF-kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, resulted in striking differences in cytokine and chemokine gene transcription, suggesting that TLR2 and TLR4 signaling is not equivalent. A TLR4 agonist specifically promoted the production of the Th1-inducing cytokine interleukin (IL) 12 p70 and the chemokine interferon-gamma inducible protein (IP)-10, which is also associated to Th1 responses. In contrast, TLR2 stimulation failed to induce IL-12 p70 and interferon-gamma inducible protein (IP)-10 but resulted in the release of the IL-12 inhibitory p40 homodimer, producing conditions that are predicted to favor Th2 development. TLR2 stimulation also resulted in preferential induction of IL-8 and p19/IL-23. Involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p38 MAPK in the TLR-mediated induction of several cytokine and chemokine messages was demonstrated using specific inhibitors. Thus, TLRs can translate the information regarding the nature of pathogens into differences in the cytokines and chemokines produced by dendritic cells and therefore may contribute to the polarization of the acquired immune response.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is a prevalent human pathogen that successfully establishes chronic infection, which leads to clinically significant gastric diseases including chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and gastric cancer (GC). H. pylori is able to produce a persistent infection due in large part to its ability to hijack the host immune response. The host adaptive immune response is activated to strategically and specifically attack pathogens and normally clears them from the infected host. Since B and T lymphocytes are central mediators of adaptive immunity, in this chapter we review their development and the fundamental mechanisms regulating their activation in order to understand how some of the normal processes are subverted by H. pylori. In this review, we place particular emphasis on the CD4+ T cell responses, their subtypes, and regulatory mechanisms because of the expanding literature in this area related to H. pylori. T lymphocyte differentiation and function are finely orchestrated through a series of cell-cell interactions, which include immune checkpoint receptors. Among the immune checkpoint receptor family, there are some with inhibitory properties that are exploited by tumor cells to facilitate their immune evasion. Gastric epithelial cells (GECs), which act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the gastric mucosa, are induced by H. pylori to express immune checkpoint receptors known to sway T lymphocyte function and thus circumvent effective T effector lymphocyte responses. This chapter reviews these and other mechanisms used by H. pylori to interfere with host immunity in order to persist.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a powerful method for the analysis of gene expression. Target gene expression levels are usually normalized to a consistently expressed reference gene also known as internal standard, in the same sample. However, much effort has not been expended thus far in the search for reference genes suitable for the study of stomach cancer using RT-qPCR, although selection of optimal reference genes is critical for interpretation of results. METHODS We assessed the suitability of six possible reference genes, beta-actin (ACTB), glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 (HPRT1), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), ribosomal subunit L29 (RPL29) and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) in 20 normal and tumor stomach tissue pairs of stomach cancer patients and 6 stomach cancer cell lines, by RT-qPCR. Employing expression stability analyses using NormFinder and geNorm algorithms we determined the order of performance of these reference genes and their variation values. RESULTS This RT-qPCR study showed that there are statistically significant (p {$<$} 0.05) differences in the expression levels of HPRT1 and 18S rRNA in 'normal-' versus 'tumor stomach tissues'. The stability analyses by geNorm suggest B2M-GAPDH, as best reference gene combination for 'stomach cancer cell lines'; RPL29-HPRT1, for 'all stomach tissues'; and ACTB-18S rRNA, for 'all stomach cell lines and tissues'. NormFinder also identified B2M as the best reference gene for 'stomach cancer cell lines', RPL29-B2M for 'all stomach tissues', and 18S rRNA-ACTB for 'all stomach cell lines and tissues'. The comparisons of normalized expression of the target gene, GPNMB, showed different interpretation of target gene expression depend on best single reference gene or combination. CONCLUSION This study validated RPL29 and RPL29-B2M as the best single reference genes and combination, for RT-qPCR analysis of 'all stomach tissues', and B2M and B2M-GAPDH as the best single reference gene and combination, for 'stomach cancer cell lines'. Use of these validated reference genes should provide more exact interpretation of differential gene expressions at transcription level in stomach cancer.},

In this work, we examined the frequency of the cagA, vacA and iceA genotypes in H. pylori strains isolated from Brazilian patients and correlated these with the clinical manifestations. H. pylori was isolated from 165 patients [30 with non-ulcer dyspepsia cases (NUD); 93 peptic ulcer disease (PUD): 31 gastric ulcers (GU) and 62 duodenal ulcer disease (DU); 18 with erosive gastritis (EG); and 24 gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)]. Allelic variants of cagA, vacA and iceA were identified using the polymerase chain reaction. More than one H. pylori strain was detected in 28 cases (17\%), and these were excluded from the statistical analysis. We were unable to confirm an association between iceA status and clinical outcome. There was a strong association between the genotype cagA-positive vacA s1 and PUD. However, logistic regression analysis showed that vacA s1 was the only predictive factor for PUD (OR=4.19; 95\% CI 1.95-8.98). The presence of the less virulent strain vacA s2 was related to GERD (OR=8.59; 95\% CI 2.85-25.91). Our results support the hypothesis that virulent strains may protect against the development of GERD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Helicobacter pylori infection is the major cause of peptic ulceration and gastric adenocarcinoma. To address the hypothesis that the human acquired immune response to H. pylori influences pathogenesis, we characterised the gastric T helper (Th) and regulatory T cell (Treg) response of infected patients. METHODS: The human gastric CD4(+) T cell response of 28 donors who were infected with H. pylori and 44 who were not infected was analysed using flow cytometry. The T cell associated mucosal cytokine response was analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay of samples from 38 infected and 22 uninfected donors. Recombinant interleukin 10 (IL10) was added to co-cultures of H. pylori and AGS cells and its suppressive effects upon inflammatory responses were measured. RESULTS: We found that the H. pylori-specific response consists of both T helper 1 and 2 subsets with high levels of IL10-secreting Tregs. People with peptic ulcer disease had a 2.4-fold reduced CD4(+)CD25(hi)IL10(+) Treg response (p = 0.05) but increased Th1 and Th2 responses (Th1: 3.2-fold, p = 0.038; Th2: 6.1-fold, p = 0.029) compared to those without ulcers. In vitro studies showed that IL10 inhibited IL8 expression and activation of nuclear factor kappa B induced by H. pylori in gastric epithelial cells, and enhanced H. pylori growth in a bacterial-cell co-culture model. CONCLUSIONS: Together our data suggest that H. pylori induces a regulatory T cell response, possibly contributing to its peaceful coexistence with the human host, and that ulcers occur when this regulatory response is inadequate.},

The most convincing of these are supported by published mechanistic data, for example with animal models, or incidence of disease exacerbation in humans following H. pylori eradication. Although controversial, this field is very important as the prevalence of H. pylori is decreasing throughout the world whilst many chronic diseases are becoming more common. These trends are likely to continue in the future, therefore it is important that we fully understand if and how H. pylori confers protection.},

Prostaglandin (PG) E2 is the most abundant eicosanoid in the inflammatory milieu due to the robust production elicited by pathogen-associated molecular patterns on cells of the innate immune system. The different functions and cell distribution of E prostanoid receptors explain the difficulty encountered thus far to delineate the actual role of PGE2 in the immune response. The biosynthesis of eicosanoids includes as the first step the Ca(2+)- and kinase-dependent activation of the cytosolic phospholipase A2, which releases arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids, and later events depending on the transcriptional regulation of the enzymes of the cyclooxygenase routes, where PGE2 is the most relevant product. Acting in an autocrine/paracrine manner in macrophages, PGE2 induces a regulatory phenotype including the expression of interleukin (IL)-10, sphingosine kinase 1, and the tumor necrosis factor family molecule LIGHT. PGE2 also stabilizes the suppressive function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, inhibits the release of IL-12 p70 by macrophages and dendritic cells, and may enhance the production of IL-23. PGE2 is a central component of the inflammasome-dependent induction of the eicosanoid storm that leads to massive loss of intravascular fluid, increases the mortality rate associated with coinfection by Candida ssp. and bacteria, and inhibits fungal phagocytosis. These effects have important consequences for the outcome of infections and the polarization of the immune response into the T helper cell types 2 and 17 and can be a clue to develop pharmacological tools to address infectious, autoimmune, and autoinflammatory diseases.},

Here we show that the IL-12 receptor (IL12R) {$\beta$}2 subunit, a recently cloned binding and signal transducing component of the IL-12R, is expressed on human Th1 but not Th2 clones and is induced during differentiation of human naive cells along the Th1 but not the Th2 pathway. IL-12 and type I but not type II interferons induce expression of the IL-12R {$\beta$}2 chain during in vitro T cell differentiation after antigen receptor triggering. The selective expression and regulation of the IL-12R {$\beta$}2 subunit may help to understand the basis of Th1/Th2 differentiation and may provide therapeutic options for altering the Th1/Th2 balance in several immuno-pathological conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies.},

Translocated CagA is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation involving Src-family kinases. The mechanism and structural basis for type IV protein secretion is not well understood. We describe here, by confocal laser scanning microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy, a novel filamentous surface organelle which is part of the Hp T4SS. The organelle is often located at one bacterial pole but can be induced by cell contact also along the lateral side of the bacteria. It consists of a rigid needle, covered focally or completely by HP0527 (Cag7 or CagY), a VirB10-homologous protein. HP0527 is also clustered in the outer membrane. The VirB7-homologous protein HP0532 is found at the base of this organelle. These observations demonstrate for the first time by microscopic techniques a complex T4SS-associated, sheathed surface organelle reminiscent to the needle structures of bacterial type III secretion systems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In humans there are epidemiological data suggesting a protective effect of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection against the development of autoimmune diseases and in addition, there are laboratory data illustrating H. pylori's ability to induce immune tolerance and limit inflammatory responses. Thus, numerous observational studies have examined the association between H. pylori infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with various results. OBJECTIVE: We performed a meta-analysis of available studies to better define the association of H. pylori infection and IBD. METHODS: Medical literature searches for human studies were performed through September 2014, using suitable keywords. In each study the risk ratio (RR) of H. pylori infection in IBD patients vs controls was calculated and pooled estimates were obtained using fixed- or random-effects models as appropriate. Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated using Cochran Q test and I(2) statistics, whereas the likelihood of publication bias was assessed by constructing funnel plots. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies were eligible for meta-analysis, including 4400 IBD patients and 4763 controls. Overall 26.5\% of IBD patients were positive for H. pylori infection, compared to 44.7\% of individuals in the control group. There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies (Q\,=\,137.2, df (Q) =32, I(2) (\,)=\,77\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and therefore the random-effects model of meta-analysis was used. The obtained pool RR estimation was 0.62 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.71, test for overall effect Z\,=\,-7.04, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). There was no evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis showed a significant negative association between H. pylori infection and IBD that supports a possible protective benefit of H. pylori infection against the development of IBD.},

Studies on humans, non-human primates, and rodents have reported that regulating proteins of the Th1 phenotype predominate in the immune response to the bacterial infection. The cytokines produced by this phenotype, are not very effective in eradicating the microorganism and furthermore, contribute to gastro-duodenal pathogenesis. Gastric inflammation in patients infected with H. pylori has been characterized by increased production of IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, TNF-{$\alpha$}, and IFN-{$\gamma$}. Many prophylactic and therapeutic strategies have been researched using experimental animals. The utilization and effectiveness of vaccination on humans requires more study.},

The present study describes the therapeutic vaccination of experimentally H. pylori-infected beagle dogs, an animal model that reproduces several aspects of the human infection with H. pylori. The vaccine consisted of three recombinant H. pylori antigens, CagA, VacA, and NAP, formulated at different doses (10, 25, or 50 microg each) with alum and administered intramuscularly either weekly or monthly. No adverse effects were observed after vaccination and a good immunoglobulin G response was generated against each of the three antigens. Bacterial colonization and gastritis were decreased after the completion of the vaccination cycle, especially in the case of the monthly immunization schedule. In conclusion, therapeutic vaccination in the beagle dog model was safe and immunogenic and was able to limit H. pylori colonization and the related gastric pathology.},

Differential screening of this library yielded several clones with a very restricted tissue specificity, including one that we named CTLA-8. CTLA-8 transcripts could be detected only in T cell hybridoma clones related to the one used to prepare the library. Southern blots showed that the CTLA-8 gene was single copy in mice, rats, and humans. By radioactive in situ hybridization, the CTLA-8 gene was mapped at a single site on mouse chromosome 1A and human chromosome 2q31, in a known interspecific syntenic region. The CTLA-8 cDNA sequence indicated the presence, in the 3'-untranslated region of the mRNA, of AU-rich repeats previously found in the mRNA of various cytokines, growth factors, and oncogenes. The CTLA-8 cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding a putative protein of 150 amino acids. This protein was 57\% homologous to the putative protein encoded by the ORF13 gene of herpesvirus Saimiri, a T lymphotropic virus. These findings are discussed in the context of other genes of this herpesvirus homologous to known immunologically active molecules. More generally, CTLA-8 may belong to the growing set of virus-captured functionally important cellular genes related to the immune system or to cell death and cell survival.},

A typical response at this point is to vary one or more of the many parameters that are known to contribute to primer-template fidelity and primer extension. High on the list of optimization variables are Mg++ concentrations, buffer pH, and cycling conditions. With regard to the last, the annealing temperature is most important. The situation is further complicated by the fact that some of the variables are quite interdependent. For example, because dNTPs directly chelate a proportional number of Mg++ ions, an increase in the concentration of dNTPs decreases the concentration of free Mg++ available to influence polymerase function.

These major bacterial components possess unique features from those of other gram-negative organisms, including differences in structure, assembly, and modification. These defining characteristics of H. pylori glycobiology help the pathogen establish a long-lived infection by providing camouflage, modulating the host immune response, and promoting virulence mechanisms.

Despite a critical role for Treg cells in maintaining lympho-myeloid homeostasis, it remains unclear whether a single mechanism or multiple mechanisms of Treg cell-mediated suppression are operating in vivo and how redundant such mechanisms might be. Here we addressed these questions by examining the role of the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-10 in Treg cell-mediated suppression. Analyses of mice in which the Treg cell-specific ablation of a conditional IL-10 allele was induced by Cre recombinase knocked into the Foxp3 gene locus showed that although IL-10 production by Treg cells was not required for the control of systemic autoimmunity, it was essential for keeping immune responses in check at environmental interfaces such as the colon and lungs. Our study suggests that Treg cells utilize multiple means to limit immune responses. Furthermore, these mechanisms are likely to be nonredundant, in that a distinct suppressor mechanism most likely plays a prominent and identifiable role at a particular tissue and inflammatory setting.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with the development of a chronic inflammatory response, which may induce peptic ulcers, gastric cancer (GC), and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Chronic H. pylori infection promotes the genetic instability of gastric epithelial cells and interferes with the DNA repair systems in host cells. Colonization of the stomach with H. pylori is an important cause of non-cardia GC and gastric MALT lymphoma. The reduction of GC development in patients who underwent anti-H. pylori eradication schemes has also been well described. Individual susceptibility to GC development depends on the host's genetic predisposition, H. pylori virulence factors, environmental conditions, and geographical determinants. Biological determinants are urgently sought to predict the clinical course of infection in individuals with confirmed H. pylori infection. Possible candidates for such biomarkers include genetic aberrations such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in various cytokines/growth factors (e.g., IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A/B, IFN-{$\gamma$}, TNF, TGF-{$\beta$}) and their receptors (IL-RN, TGFR), innate immunity receptors (TLR2, TLR4, CD14, NOD1, NOD2), enzymes involved in signal transduction cascades (PLCE1, PKLR, PRKAA1) as well as glycoproteins (MUC1, PSCA), and DNA repair enzymes (ERCC2, XRCC1, XRCC3). Bacterial determinants related to GC development include infection with CagA-positive (particularly with a high number of EPIYA-C phosphorylation motifs) and VacA-positive isolates (in particular s1/m1 allele strains). The combined genotyping of bacterial and host determinants suggests that the accumulation of polymorphisms favoring host and bacterial features increases the risk for precancerous and cancerous lesions in patients.},

In the gastric mucosa, atrophy is defined as the loss of appropriate glands. There are several etiological types of gastritis, their different etiology being related to different clinical manifestations and pathological features. Atrophic gastritis (resulting mainly from long-standing Helicobacter pylori infection) is a major risk factor for the onset of (intestinal type) gastric cancer. The extent and site of the atrophic changes correlate significantly with the cancer risk. The current format for histology reporting in cases of gastritis fails to establish an immediate link between gastritis phenotype and risk of malignancy. Building on current knowledge of the biology of gastritis, an international group of pathologists [Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment (OLGA)] has proposed a system for reporting gastritis in terms of its stage (the OLGA Staging System): this system places the histological phenotypes of gastritis on a scale of progressively increasing gastric cancer risk, from the lowest (Stage 0) to the highest (Stage IV). The aim of this tutorial is to provide unequivocal information on how to standardize histology reports on gastritis in diagnostic practice.},

RECENT FINDINGS Recent findings presented in this review are as follows: CagA interferes with tumor suppression; tolerance protects from H. pylori-induced disease; modified H. pylori treatments/regimens can afford higher efficacy than the standard triple therapy. SUMMARY H. pylori colonizes the human stomach causing gastritis and severe diseases including gastric cancer. One of the most dangerous H. pylori factors, CagA, has been investigated in relation to gastric cancer: recently this relationship was strongly reinforced by the finding that CagA interacts with the tumor suppressor apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53-2 (ASPP2), promoting p53 degradation. Treg have been proposed to be involved in H. pylori infection and gastric disease: recent findings suggest that Treg-induced tolerance, rather than immunity to H. pylori, may result in less severe disease. The eradication rates achieved with the standard triple therapy dropped below 80\%, mainly due to antibiotic resistance, while no vaccines are currently licensed; new treatments/regimens were subjected to clinical trials, in some cases strongly increasing the eradication rates.},

  abstract = {RNA transcripts such as mRNA or microRNA are frequently used as biomarkers to determine disease state or response to therapy. Reverse transcription (RT) in combination with quantitative PCR (qPCR) has become the method of choice to quantify small amounts of such RNA molecules. In parallel with the democratization of RT-qPCR and its increasing use in biomedical research or biomarker discovery, we witnessed a growth in the number of gene expression data analysis methods. Most of these methods are based on the principle that the position of the amplification curve with respect to the cycle-axis is a measure for the initial target quantity: the later the curve, the lower the target quantity. However, most methods differ in the mathematical algorithms used to determine this position, as well as in the way the efficiency of the PCR reaction (the fold increase of product per cycle) is determined and applied in the calculations. Moreover, there is dispute about whether the PCR efficiency is constant or continuously decreasing. Together this has lead to the development of different methods to analyze amplification curves. In published comparisons of these methods, available algorithms were typically applied in a restricted or outdated way, which does not do them justice. Therefore, we aimed at development of a framework for robust and unbiased assessment of curve analysis performance whereby various publicly available curve analysis methods were thoroughly compared using a previously published large clinical data set (Vermeulen et al., 2009) [11]. The original developers of these methods applied their algorithms and are co-author on this study. We assessed the curve analysis methods' impact on transcriptional biomarker identification in terms of expression level, statistical significance, and patient-classification accuracy. The concentration series per gene, together with data sets from unpublished technical performance experiments, were analyzed in order to assess the algorithms' precision, bias, and resolution. While large differences exist between methods when considering the technical performance experiments, most methods perform relatively well on the biomarker data. The data and the analysis results per method are made available to serve as benchmark for further development and evaluation of qPCR curve analysis methods (http://qPCRDataMethods.hfrc.nl).},

We quantified the cost-effectiveness of such a vaccine in the United States, using a dynamic transmission model. METHODS: We compartmentalized the population by age, infection status, and clinical disease state and measured effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We simulated no intervention, vaccination of infants, and vaccination of school-age children. Variables included costs of vaccine, vaccine administration, and gastric cancer treatment (in 2007 US dollars), vaccine efficacy, quality adjustment due to gastric cancer, and discount rate. We evaluated possible outcomes for periods of 10-75 years. RESULTS: H. pylori vaccination of infants would cost \$2.9 billion over 10 years; savings from cancer prevention would be realized decades later. Over a long time horizon (75 years), incremental costs of H. pylori vaccination would be \$1.8 billion, and incremental QALYs would be 0.5 million, yielding a cost-effectiveness ratio of \$3871/QALY. With school-age vaccination, the cost-effectiveness ratio would be \$22,137/QALY. With time limited to {$<$}40 years, the cost-effectiveness ratio exceeded \$50,000/QALY. CONCLUSION: When evaluated with a time horizon beyond 40 years, the use of a prophylactic H. pylori vaccine was cost-effective in the United States, especially with infant vaccination.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The challenge of determining amplification efficiency has long been a predominant aspect of implementing real-time qPCR, playing a critical role in the accuracy and reliability that can be achieved. Based upon analysis of amplification profile position, standard curves are currently the gold standard for amplification efficiency determination. However, in addition to being highly resource intensive, the efficacy of this approach is limited by the necessary assumption that all samples are amplified with the same efficiency as predicted by a standard curve. These limitations have driven efforts to develop methods for determining amplification efficiency by analyzing the fluorescence readings from individual amplification reactions. The most prominent approach is based on analysis of the "log-linear region", founded upon the presumption that amplification efficiency is constant within this region. Nevertheless, a recently developed sigmoidal model has provided new insights that challenge such historically held views, dictating that amplification efficiency is not only dynamic, but is linearly coupled to amplicon DNA quantity. Called "linear regression of efficiency" or LRE, this kinetic-based approach redefines amplification efficiency as the maximal efficiency (Emax) generated at the onset of thermocycling. RESULTS This study presents a critical evaluation of amplification efficiency determination, which reveals that potentially large underestimations occur when exponential mathematics is applied to the log-linear region. This discrepancy was found to stem from misinterpreting the origin of the log-linear region, which is derived not from an invariant amplification efficiency, but rather from an exponential loss in amplification rate. In contrast, LRE analysis generated Emax estimates that correlated closely to that derived from a standard curve, despite the fact that standard curve analysis is founded upon exponential mathematics. This paradoxical result implies that the quantitative efficacy of positional-based analysis relies not upon the exponential character of real-time PCR, but instead on the ability to precisely define the relative position of an amplification profile. CONCLUSION In addition to presenting insights into the sigmoidal character of the polymerase chain reaction, LRE analysis provides a viable alternative to standard curves for amplification efficiency determination, based on analysis of high-quality fluorescence readings within the central region of SYBR Green I generated amplification profiles.},

To examine this issue, we analyzed multiple single-colony isolates from two to four separate stomach biopsies of eight adult and four pediatric patients from a high-incidence Mexican population. Eleven of the 12 patients contained isolates with identical random amplified polymorphic DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphism, and vacA allele molecular footprints, whereas a single adult patient had two distinct profiles. Comparative genomic hybridization using whole-genome microarrays (array CGH) revealed variation in 24 to 67 genes in isolates from patients with similar molecular footprints. The one patient with distinct profiles contained two strain populations differing at 113 gene loci, including the cag pathogenicity island virulence genes. The two strain populations in this single host had different spatial distributions in the stomach and exhibited very limited genetic exchange. The total genetic divergence and pairwise genetic divergence between isolates from adults and isolates from children were not statistically different. We also analyzed isolates obtained 15 and 90 days after experimental infection of humans and found no evidence of genetic divergence, indicating that transmission to a new host does not induce rapid genetic changes in the bacterial population in the human stomach. Our data suggest that humans are infected with a population of closely related strains that vary at a small number of gene loci, that this population of strains may already be present when an infection is acquired, and that even during superinfection genetic exchange among distinct strains is rare.},

This study demonstrates that combined treatment with IL-2 and IL-27 induces potent antitumor activity in disseminated neuroblastoma metastasis. Complete durable tumor regression was achieved in 90\% of mice bearing metastatic TBJ-IL-27 tumors treated with IL-2 compared with only 40\% of mice bearing TBJ-IL-27 tumors alone and 0\% of mice bearing TBJ-FLAG tumors with or without IL-2 treatment. Comparable antitumor effects were achieved by IL-27 protein produced upon hydrodynamic IL-27 plasmid DNA delivery when combined with IL-2. Although delivery of IL-27 alone, or in combination with IL-2, mediated pronounced regression of neuroblastoma metastases in the liver, combined delivery of IL-27 and IL-2 was far more effective than IL-27 alone against bone marrow metastases. Combined exposure to IL-27 produced by tumor and IL-2 synergistically enhances the generation of tumor-specific CTL reactivity. Potentiation of CTL reactivity by IL-27 occurs via mechanisms that appear to be engaged during both the initial sensitization and effector phase. Potent immunologic memory responses are generated in mice cured of their disseminated disease by combined delivery of IL-27 and IL-2, and depletion of CD8(+) ablates the antitumor efficacy of this combination. Moreover, IL-27 delivery can inhibit the expansion of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory and IL-17-expressing CD4(+) cells that are otherwise observed among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from mice treated with IL-2. These studies demonstrate that IL-27 and IL-2 synergistically induce complete tumor regression and long-term survival in mice bearing widely metastatic neuroblastoma tumors.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori contains a pathogenicity island, cagPAI, with genes homologous to components of the type IV secretion system (T4SS) of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The T4SS components assemble a structure that transfers CagA protein and peptidoglycan into host epithelial cells, causing the increased release of interleukin 8 (IL8) from the cells. The Toll-like receptors on neutrophils recognize H. pylori, initiating signaling pathways that enhance the activation of NF-{$\kappa$}B. However, the roles of cagPAI and T4SS in the inflammatory response of neutrophils are unknown. We evaluated the participation of cagPAI and T4SS in the response of human neutrophils to H. pylori infection. Neutrophils were isolated from the blood of healthy donors and infected with H. pylori cagPAI(+), cagPAI(-), and cagPAI mutant strains virB4 (-) and virD4 (-). Whereas cagPAI(+) strain 26695 induced the greatest IL8 production, a proinflammatory response, cagPAI(-) strain 8822 induced the greatest IL10 production, an anti-inflammatory response. In contrast, the virB4 (-) and virD4 (-) mutant strains produced significantly more of the two proinflammatory cytokines IL1{$\beta$} and tumor necrosis factor {$\alpha$}than the cagPAI(+) strain 26695. We observed that H. pylori downregulated the expression of TLRs 2 and 5 but upregulated TLR9 expression in a cagPAI and T4SS-independent manner. These results show for the first time that the response of human neutrophils to H. pylori may vary from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory response, depending on cagPAI and the integrity of T4SS.},

The large increase in drug-resistant strains makes the formulation of new therapeutic strategies fundamental. The frequent onset of side effects during antibiotic treatment (mainly due to intestinal dysbiosis) should not be underestimated as it may cause the interruption of treatment, failure of H. pylori eradication and clonal selection of resistant bacteria. Probiotic integration during antibiotic treatment can exert a dual function: a direct antagonistic effect on H. pylori and a balancing effect on dysbiosis. Therefore, it fulfills the definition of a new therapeutic strategy to successfully treat H. pylori infection. Data reported in literature give promising but discrepant results. AIM: To assess in vitro bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of probiotic strains against H. pylori. MATERIALS AND METHODS: L. casei, L. paracasei, L. acidophilus, B. lactis and S. thermophilus strains were used. Agar well diffusion and time-kill curves were carried out to detect bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity, respectively. RESULTS: All probiotic strains showed both bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity vs. H. pylori. CONCLUSIONS: Such findings prompted us to plan a protocol of treatment in which probiotics are given to infected patients in association with antibiotic therapy.},

Now, the large-scale analysis of proteins (proteomics) is a mainstay of biological research and clinical translation, with researchers seeking molecular diagnostics, as well as protein-based markers for personalized medicine. Proteomic strategies using the protease trypsin (known as bottom-up proteomics) were the first to be developed and optimized and form the dominant approach at present. However, researchers are now beginning to understand the limitations of bottom-up techniques, namely the inability to characterize and quantify intact protein molecules from a complex mixture of digested peptides. To overcome these limitations, several laboratories are taking a whole-protein-based approach, in which intact protein molecules are the analytical targets for characterization and quantification. We discuss these top-down techniques and how they have been applied to clinical research and are likely to be applied in the near future. Given the recent improvements in mass-spectrometry-based proteomics and stronger cooperation between researchers, clinicians and statisticians, both peptide-based (bottom-up) strategies and whole-protein-based (top-down) strategies are set to complement each other and help researchers and clinicians better understand and detect complex disease phenotypes.},

We report here that the C57BL/6 mouse model of experimental infection with the closely related Helicobacter felis recapitulates this wide range in host susceptibility. Although the majority of infected animals develop premalignant lesions such as gastric atrophy, compensatory epithelial hyperplasia, and intestinal metaplasia, a subset of mice is completely protected from preneoplasia. Protection is associated with a failure to mount an IFN-gamma response to the infection and with a concomitant high Helicobacter burden. Using a vaccine model as well as primary infection and adoptive transfer models, we demonstrate that IFN-gamma, secreted predominantly by CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T(H) cells, is essential for Helicobacter clearance, but at the same time mediates the formation of preneoplastic lesions. We further provide evidence that IFN-gamma triggers a common transcriptional program in murine gastric epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo and induces their preferential transformation to the hyperplastic phenotype. In summary, our data suggest a dual role for IFN-gamma in Helicobacter pathogenesis that could be the basis for the differential susceptibility to H. pylori-induced gastric pathology in the human population.},

The potential counterregulatory role of B cells in balancing pathogen-specific immune responses and the associated immunopathology is less well understood owing to the lack of appropriate persistent infection models. In this paper, we show that B cells have the ability to negatively regulate adaptive immune responses to bacterial pathogens. Using mouse models of infection with Helicobacter felis, a close relative of the human gastrointestinal pathogen H. pylori, we found that B cells activated by Helicobacter TLR-2 ligands induce IL-10-producing CD4(+)CD25(+) T regulatory-1 (Tr-1)-like cells in vitro and in vivo. Tr-1 conversion depends on TCR signaling and a direct T-/B-interaction through CD40/CD40L and CD80/CD28. B cell-induced Tr-1 cells acquire suppressive activity in vitro and suppress excessive gastric Helicobacter-associated immunopathology in vivo. Adoptive cotransfer of MyD88-proficient B cells and Tr-1 cells restores a normal gastric mucosal architecture in MyD88(-/-) and IL-10(-/-) mice in a manner that depends on T cellular, but not B cellular, IL-10 production. Our findings describe a novel mechanism of B cell-dependent Tr-1 cell generation and function in a clinically relevant disease model. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the B cell/Tr-1 cell axis is essential for balancing the control of Helicobacter infection with the prevention of excessive Th1-driven gastric immunopathology, promoting gastric mucosal homeostasis on the one hand and facilitating Helicobacter persistence on the other.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Helicobacter pylori colonizes the human gastric mucosa of {$>$}50\% of the world's population. Most of the patients have no overt clinical symptoms. However, the infection is invariably associated with the development of active chronic gastritis, leading in some cases to the development of peptic ulcer disease, distal gastric adenocarcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. In contrast to most other pathogens, infection with H pylori persists lifelong, but reasons for the persistence remain obscure. CD4-positive T cells are crucial for bacterial elimination but are inhibited by H pylori. We aimed to identify the factor responsible for suppression of T-cell response and characterize this inhibitory effect on a cellular and molecular level. METHODS: Using size-exclusion chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a spectrophotometric enzyme assay, we identified the secreted gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase of H pylori (HPGGT) as the factor responsible for inhibition of T-cell proliferation. RESULTS: Mutagenesis of HPGGT in different H pylori strains completely abrogated this inhibitory effect. Recombinantly expressed HPGGT protein showed full antiproliferative activity. Site-directed mutagenesis and application of the GGT inhibitor acivicin revealed that inhibition of T cells depends on catalytic activity of HPGGT. Cell cycle analysis of human T cells indicated that HPGGT was necessary and sufficient to induce G(1) arrest. Reduced levels of c-Myc and phosphorylated c-Raf protein suggest the disruption of Ras-dependent signaling by HPGGT. CONCLUSIONS: GGT is a novel immunosuppressive factor of H pylori inhibiting T-cell proliferation by induction of a cell cycle arrest in the G(1) phase.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND It has been suggested that Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with an exaggerated T-helper 1 cytokine response manifested by increased production of interleukin (IL)-12. IL-12 is a heterodimeric protein comprising 2 disulfide-linked subunits designated p35 and p40. Recently, IL-12-related cytokines, IL-23 and IL-27, were described. Biologically active IL-23 is a heterodimer whose p40 subunit is identical to IL-12p40 whereas its p19 subunit is distantly related to IL-12p35. IL-27 consists of EBI3, an IL-12p40-related protein, and p28, a newly discovered IL-12p35-related polypeptide. AIM We sought to determine whether mucosal expression of IL-23p19 and IL-27p28 transcripts correlate with the inflammatory activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PATIENTS/METHODS Messenger RNA expression in colonic mucosa from patients with Crohn's disease (CD; n = 37) and ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 19), and in non-IBD control subjects (specific colitis [SC]; n = 16) and normal, nondiseased control patients (n = 12) was measured by reverse-transcribed real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS IL-23p19 was significantly increased in inflamed mucosa in CD (P = 0.0377) and to a lesser extent also in UC patients but not in SC patients. Elevation of IL-23p19 transcript levels in CD correlated with the severity of endoscopic lesions. IL-27p28 transcripts and EBI3 transcripts were significantly elevated only in active CD. DISCUSSION IL-23p19, IL-27p28, and EBI3 transcripts are strongly up-regulated in CD. The stimulatory effects of these cytokines on naive T cells in addition to a strongly synergistic action with IL-12 to trigger interferon-gamma production may contribute to the perpetuation of the inflammatory process in patients with CD. Notably, increased expression of IL-23 and IL-27 transcripts in CD suggests a T helper 1-dominated immunologic function in this disease.},

Here we report on the cloning and genetic characterization of an H. pylori gene named vacA, which encodes the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA, a novel type of antigenic bacterial toxin that induces the formation of intracellular vacuoles in epithelial cells. The vacuolating cytotoxin activity is expressed by a subset of clinical isolates (Vac+), all of which produce the 87 kDa cytotoxin antigen, but strains which produce neither the activity nor the cytotoxin protein (Vac-) also carry the gene. Isogenic H. pylori mutants in vacA generated by transposon shuttle mutagenesis produce neither the VacA antigen nor a vacuolating activity in a cell culture model. The vacA gene itself encodes a precursor protein of 139.6 kDa consisting of a 33-amino acid signal sequence, the 87 kDa cytotoxin and a 50 kDa C-terminal domain with features typical of a bacterial outer membrane protein. The VacA precursor shows no significant primary sequence homology with any previously reported protein, but its structural organization closely resembles the IgA protease-type of exoprotein produced by pathogenic Neisseriae and Haemophilus species. Our current data support a model for secretion of the cytotoxin through the two bacterial membranes which involves the 50 kDa domain for outer membrane translocation with subsequent proteolytic cleavage and release of the mature 87 kDa cytotoxin into the extracellular environment.},

Moreover, IL-27 promotes proliferation and cytotoxic functions of mouse CD8(+) T lymphocytes, but no data are available on human CD8(+) T cells. We investigated the impact of IL-27 on human CD8(+) T cells. In contrast to mouse T cells, the IL-27 receptor (IL-27R), composed of T cell cytokine receptor (TCCR) and gp130, was detected on a greater percentage of human CD8(+) than CD4(+) T cells and these proportions increased upon polyclonal activation. IL-27 induced rapid STAT1 and STAT3 signaling, enhanced STAT1 protein levels, and induced SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression in a STAT1-dependent manner by human CD8(+) T cells. Addition of IL-27 to {$\alpha$}-CD3-activated na\"ive CD8(+) T cells significantly increased T-box transcription factor expression levels, cell proliferation, and IFN-{$\gamma$} and granzyme B production leading to increased CD8(+) T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

To identify which chemical gradient guides the bacteria within the mucus layer, combinations of luminal perfusion, dialysis, and ventilation were used to modify or invert transmucus gradients in anaesthetized Helicobacter-infected mice and Mongolian gerbils. Neither changes in lumen or arterial pH nor inversion of bicarbonate/CO2 or urea/ammonium gradients disturbed Helicobacter orientation. However, elimination of the mucus pH gradient by simultaneous reduction of arterial pH and bicarbonate concentration perturbed orientation, causing the bacteria to spread over the entire mucus layer. H. pylori thus uses the gastric mucus pH gradient for chemotactic orientation.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori-induced mucosal inflammation results in high production of interleukin 17 (IL-17), a potent inducer of IL-8 in gastric epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to investigate signaling pathways by which IL-17 regulates IL-8 production in human gastric epithelial cells. Activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in both IL-17-stimulated MKN28 cells and epithelial cells isolated from H. pylori-colonized gastric mucosa was assessed by Western blotting. In IL-17-stimulated MKN28 cells the activation of activatior protein 1 (AP-1), nuclear factor (NF)-IL-6, and NF-kappaB was also assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. IL-8 production was evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) both for IL-17-stimulated MKN28 cells treated with specific MAP kinase inhibitors and gastric biopsy cultures treated with a neutralizing IL-17 antibody. Serum from H. pylori-infected patients was tested for immunoglobulin G response to CagA by ELISA. Treatment of MKN28 cells with IL-17 caused activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) but not other MAP kinases and had the downstream effects of AP-1 and NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 synthesis. Blocking ERK 1/2 activity inhibited AP-1-mediated, but not NF-kappaB-mediated, IL-8 induction. Enhanced activation of ERK 1/2 was seen in gastric epithelial cells isolated from H. pylori-infected patients in comparison to uninfected controls, and this was associated with high IL-8. These effects were even more pronounced in patients seropositive for CagA than in seronegative ones. In gastric biopsy cultures, the addition of a neutralizing IL-17 antibody decreased ERK 1/2 activation, thus resulting in a significant inhibition of IL-8. In H. pylori-colonized gastric epithelial cells, IL-17-induced IL-8 synthesis is associated with and depends at least in part on the activation of ERK 1/2 MAP kinase.},

The activity of H. pylori extracts was assessed in distinct cell lines with high expression of PAR1 (RGM1 cells), PAR2 (A549 cells), or PAR2 and PAR4 (HCT-15 cells). A PAR1-activating peptide (AP), but not H. pylori extracts, caused prostaglandin E{$_2$} (PGE{$_2$}) release in RGM1 cells. On the other hand, H. pylori extracts produced release of PGE2 and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in A549 and HCT-15 cells, respectively, as a PAR2-AP did. The activity of H. pylori extracts in A549 cells was not affected by a proteinase inhibitor or exposure to boiling, but abolished by inhibitors of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IRAK-1/4 or NF-{$\kappa$}B. The activity of H. pylori extracts in HCT-15 cells was partially suppressed by boiling or the proteinase inhibitor. In rat platelets that express PAR4 and PAR3, like a PAR4-AP, H. pylori extracts induced aggregation when assessed in platelet rich plasma, an effect unaffected by the proteinase inhibitor, but did not cause aggregation of washed rat platelets that responded to the PAR4-AP or thrombin. The present study thus shows the biological activities of H. pylori extracts in A549 and HCT-15 cells or rat platelets, and suggests that they are not mediated by any PAR-activating proteinases, but may involve the other pathogenic factors including LPS.},

We monitored interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion, CagA translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation, and induction of a scattering (``hummingbird'') phenotype upon H. pylori infection of AGS gastric epithelial cells. For the first time, we have complemented individual cag PAI gene knockout mutants with their intact genes expressed from a shuttle vector and showed that complemented CagA and VirD4 restored wild-type function. Our results demonstrate that phenotypic changes and phosphorylation of CagA depended on all virB/D genes and several other genes of the cag PAI. Induction of IL-8 secretion depended largely on the same set of genes but was independent of CagA and VirD4. Thus, CagA translocation and induction of IL-8 secretion are regulated by VirD4-CagA-dependent and VirD4-CagA-independent mechanisms, respectively. The function of VirD4 as a possible adapter protein which guides CagA into the type IV secretion channel is presented in a model.},

The main reason for H. pylori treatment failure is the increasing antibiotic resistance.We assessed antibiotic susceptibility of H. pylori in a region of mid-Germany and analyzed the relationship of antibiotic resistance with the number of eradication therapies over a period of 7 years (2005-2012). METHODS: H. pylori strains were isolated from 436 patients who underwent gastroscopy for different clinical indications. Susceptibility to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, levofloxacin, and rifabutin was determined using the E-test. RESULTS: Primary, secondary, and tertiary resistances against clarithromycin were 7.5, 63.2, and 75.4\%, respectively. Primary, secondary, and tertiary resistances to levofloxacin were 11.7, 17.6, and 36.4\% and to metronidazole were 32.7, 63.2, and 80.1\%, respectively. The resistance rates against tetracycline and rifabutin were comparatively low ({$<$}5\%), even in patients with previous exposure to these antibiotics. Resistance to rifabutin increased to 6.2\% in patients who received more than two previous eradication therapies. Amoxicillin resistance was not detectable in all patients. CONCLUSION: In our region, we observed a stable, but constantly increasing, resistance rate to antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of H. pylori infection. Knowledge of the local antibiotic resistance rates is essential for developing successful treatment strategies for H. pylori eradication.},

This review focuses on the current diagnostic methods and their clinical implications, as well as on established and novel treatment strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: The increasing antimicrobial resistance has resulted in a decline of the success rate of recommended eradication regimens. The current guidelines recommend as first-line treatment clarithromycin, amoxicillin or metronidazole, and proton pump inhibitor twice daily, but recent studies have demonstrated an increasing eradication failure with these regimens. Several treatment modifications have been adopted regarding duration and combination of substances. SUMMARY: The currently recommended first-line treatments are effective and well tolerated. In areas with high antimicrobial resistance rates, new antibiotic combinations and modifications in the sequence of drug administration are proposed as alternative treatment options to standard triple therapy. Future treatment strategies have to focus on regional antimicrobial resistance adopted treatment selection and the development of new antibiotics.},

Antibiotic resistance to H. pylori is the key factor for treatment failure. At the moment, standard triple therapy remains the primary choice in regions with proven low clarithromycin resistance rates. In areas with high clarithromycin resistance, four drug treatment regimens, including quadruple and sequential therapy, have proven the best results as first-line regimens. The options for second-line treatment regimens are manifold. Second-line treatment regimens need to be adapted accurately to local resistance rates. SUMMARY: Treatment of H. pylori infection is challenged by a dramatic fall in eradication rates all over the world. Newer regimens have been introduced including sequential, quadruple therapies and those regimens provide promising results, but the knowledge about local resistance rates remains the key to an effective therapy.},

This study aimed to investigate whether the virulence factors and antibiotic resistance patterns of H. pylori differ between strains isolated from different locations of the stomach in the same patient. METHODS: H. pylori isolates were obtained from the antrum and body of the stomach. Genetic differences were examined by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting. Antibiotic resistance was assessed using the agar dilution method. Virulence factors were identified by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Among 80 patients, co-infection by two H. pylori strains was detected in 10 patients. Among the 10 pairs of H. pylori strains, differences in antibiotic resistance patterns were detected in 7 pairs (clarithromycin, 1 patient; quinolone, 3 patients; metronidazole, 4 patients) and differences in virulence factors were detected in 5 pairs. The cagA virulence gene was detected in all 10 patients, and 2 patients had H. pylori strains with different EPIYA motifs. Differences in vacA genotypes were detected in 4 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Co-infection by two H. pylori strains was confirmed by RAPD fingerprinting. Frequently, two H. pylori strains obtained from a single host differed in their virulence factors and antibiotic resistance patterns. Co-infection by multiple H. pylori strains could undermine the success of eradication therapy and should be considered when interpreting the results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests.},

Recently, new insights into the mechanisms through which H. pylori and mucosal inflammation lead to cancer development have emerged. H. pylori virulence factors, in particular specific CagA genotypes, represent main factors in gastric cancer, inducing altered intracellular signaling in epithelial cells. The chronic nature of H. pylori infection appears to relate to the VacA virulence factor and Th17/Treg mechanisms. A role of H. pylori infection in epigenetic and microRNA deregulation has been shown. Mutation of the epithelial cell genome, a hallmark of cancer, was demonstrated to accumulate in H. pylori infected stomach partly due to inadequate DNA repair. Gastric stem cells were shown to be targets of oxidative injury in the Helicobacter-inflammatory milieu. Recent advances emphasizing the contribution of bacterial factors, inflammatory mediators, and the host epithelial response in gastric carcinogenesis are reviewed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ongoing Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection triggers a chronic active gastritis. Eradicating HP reduces gastric inflammation, but does not eliminate it. We sought to characterize this persistent gastritis, and demonstrate the persistence of HP-specific Th17 responses in individuals previously infected with HP but who no longer had evidence of ongoing infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Study subjects were divided into 3 groups 55 individuals had active HP infection (group A), 41 were diagnosed with previous HP infection (group P), and 59 were na\"ive to HP (group N). Blood and gastric tissue were obtained with written informed consent from all subjects, and immune responses were evaluated using flow cytometry, semi-quantitative real time PCR, immunofluorescent staining, ELISA, and multiplex cytometric bead array for cytokine quantification. Elevated IL-17A responses were observed in patients from group A compared to group N. Interestingly, IL-17A responses remained persistently elevated in the blood and gastric mucosa of individuals from group P, despite the absence of ongoing HP infection. Using purified CD4(+) T cells as effectors and antibodies that blocked antigen presentation by MHC Class II, we showed that these persistent IL-17A responses were mediated primarily by HP-specific Th17 cells, rather than other immune cells that have also been described to secrete IL-17A. Gastric mucosal IL-1{$\beta$} levels were also persistently elevated in group P, and neutralisation of IL-1{$\beta$} reduced the HP-specific IL-17A response of purified CD4(+) T cells to autologous HP-pulsed antigen presenting cells in vitro, suggesting a functional association between IL-1{$\beta$} and the persistent Th17 response in group P patients. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Despite lack of ongoing HP infection, HP-specific Th17 cells persist in the blood and gastric mucosa of individuals with past HP infection. We speculate that this persistent inflammation might contribute to gastric mucosal pathology, for example, persistent increased gastric cancer risk despite eradication of HP.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori induces less gastric inflammation in children than adults. Here we investigated whether this reduced inflammation involves dysregulated T helper type 17 (Th17) responses. H. pylori-infected children and adults in Santiago, Chile had similar levels of H. pylori colonization, proportions of bacteria containing cagA and s1/s2 vacA markers of virulence, and strain genotypes (predominantly hpEurope), but the children had significantly reduced levels of gastric inflammation and neutrophil infiltration. The reduced neutrophil accumulation in the infected children was accompanied by significantly fewer gastric Th17 cells and significantly lower levels of interleukin (IL)-17-specific mRNA and protein compared with the infected adults. The gastric mucosa of H. pylori-infected children also contained higher numbers of IL-10+ cells and increased levels of both IL-10 and Foxp3 mRNA compared with that of the infected adults. Thus, reduced gastric inflammation, including diminished neutrophil accumulation, in H. pylori-infected children compared with infected adults is likely due to downregulated gastric Th17/IL-17 responses as a consequence of enhanced mucosal regulatory T-cell activity in the children.},

Usually a minority of infected patients develops complications such as ulcers and gastric cancer that have been associated with the presence of virulence factors (cagA, vacA) and host T helper response (Th1/Th2). Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between strain virulence and host immune response, using a multiple regression approach for the development of a model based on data collected from H. pylori infected patients in Chile. We analyzed levels of selected cytokines determined by ELISA (interleukin (IL)-12, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-4) and the presence of cagA and vacA alleles polymorphisms determined by PCR in antral biopsies of 41 patients referred to endoscopy. By multiple regression analysis we established a correlation between bacterial and host factors using clinical outcome (gastritis and duodenal ulcer) as dependent variables. The selected model was described by: clinical outcome=0.867491 (cagA)+0.0131847 (IL-12/IL-10)+0.0103503 (IFN-gamma/IL-4) and it was able to explain over 90\% of clinical outcomes observations (R(2)=96.4). This model considers that clinical outcomes are better explained by the interaction of host immune factors and strain virulence as a complex and interdependent mechanism.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-23, a recently described cytokine produced by activated antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells, is a p19/p40 heterodimer. The p40 subunit is shared with IL-12, the major Th1-driving cytokine, while p19 is distantly related to IL-12 p35. IL-23 has pro-inflammatory actions, inducing IL-17 secretion from activated CD4+ T cells, and stimulating the proliferation of memory CD4+ T cells. Here, we examined the effects of PGE2, a well-known immunomodulator, on the production of IL-23 by bone marrow- derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs). Our results indicate that PGE2 increases the production of functional IL-23 from immature BM-DCs in a time- and dose-dependent manner. PGE2 induces both the expression of p19 and p40, without affecting p35 expression. The effect of PGE2 is mediated through the specific receptors EP2/4 and is mimicked by cAMP-inducing agents, such as forskolin and dbcAMP. Although PGE2 also induces IL-1beta and IL-6 expression in non-stimulated DCs, the stimulatory effect of PGE2 on IL-23 production is not mediated through IL-1beta or IL-6. GM-CSF, the pro-inflammatory cytokine required for the generation of BM-DCs, amplifies the IL-23 inducing activity of PGE2 in a synergistic manner. Recent studies described both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of PGE2, and our results suggest an additional mechanism for its pro-inflammatory role, particularly significant for autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.},

  abstract = {We have demonstrated previously that IFN-{$\gamma$} plays a protective role in the initiation of chronic intestinal inflammation through attenuation of Toll-like receptor-mediated IL-23 induction in macrophages. Here, an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) is identified in a region of conserved nucleotide sequences in the Il23a promoter. This ISRE mediated, in part, Il23a promoter induction by LPS and inhibition of LPS-induced activity by IFN-{$\gamma$}. LPS and IFN-{$\gamma$} recruit interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) to the Il23a ISRE in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). Functionally, IRF-1 is a negative regulator of Il23a in LPS-stimulated BMMs. IRF-1(-/-) BMMs demonstrated enhanced LPS-induced Il23a expression compared with WT BMMs. Moreover, IRF-1 deficiency resulted in prolonged occupancy of RelA on the Il23a promoter. Consequently, IRF-1(-/-) mice were more susceptible to colonic injury by trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, and IL-10/IRF-1 double-deficient (IL-10/IRF-1(-/-)) mice demonstrated more severe colonic inflammation compared with IL-10(-/-) mice. The severity of colitis in both models correlated with increased colonic IL-23. CD11b(+) lamina propria mononuclear cells, comprising predominantly macrophages, were identified as the major source of IL-23 in colitis-prone mice. Basal and heat-killed Escherichia coli-stimulated levels of Il23a were increased in IL-10/IRF-1(-/-) compared with WT and IL-10(-/-) colonic CD11b(+) lamina propria mononuclear cells. In conclusion, these experiments characterize IRF-ISRE interactions on the Il23a promoter, which have in vivo relevance as a homeostatic checkpoint in chronic intestinal inflammation.},

  abstract = {After Helicobacter pylori enters the stomach, three steps are vital for infection: (i) establishing colonization; (ii) evading host immunity; and (iii) invading gastric mucosa; the last step is what is associated with diverse outcomes. Urease activity and motility mediated by the flagella of H. pylori are important in harboring colonies beneath the gastric mucus in niches adjacent to the epithelium. Several putative adhesins attach the organism to the gastric epithelium and prompt the succeeding processes for evading host immunity and invading the mucosa. Successful colonization is thus the leading and critical step. From another point of view, this can be a novel target to control this common and important infection. This review summarizes the putative adhesins that influence the evasion of host immunity, and how these could determine different clinico-pathologic outcomes. The putative adhesins include the interplay between bacterial and host Lewis antigens (type I: Le(a) and Le(b); type II: Le(x) and Le(y)), the dominant pathway between BabA and Le(b), the SabA adhesin binding to sialylated Le(x) that is upregulated in inflamed gastric tissue or those with weak-Le(b), the CagL apparatus to adapt with the alpha5beta1 integrin to mediate a type IV secretory system for CagA translocation into the epithelium; and other outer membrane proteins as HopZ, AlpA/AlpB, or OipA, without known corresponding receptors. This review implicates the adhesins vital for bugs that could be alternatively provided as novel targets for us to overcome the colonization.},

H. pylori infection induced significant expression of IL-17 and IFN-{$\gamma$} in mouse gastric tissue. IL-23 and IL-12 were increased in the gastric tissue and in H. pylori-stimulated macrophages. Cell responses were examined by intracellular staining for IFN-{$\gamma$}, IL-4, and IL-17. Mice infected with H. pylori developed a mixed Th17/Th1 response; Th17 responses preceded Th1 responses. Treatment of mice with an anti\textendash IL-17 Ab but not a control Ab significantly reduced the H. pylori burden and inflammation in the stomach. H. pylori colonization and gastric inflammation were also lower in IL-17-/- mice. Furthermore, administration of recombinant adenovirus encoding mouse IL-17 increased both H. pylori load and inflammation. Further analysis showed that the Th1 cell responses to H. pylori were downregulated when IL-17 is deficient. These results together suggest that H. pylori infection induces a mixed Th17/Th1 cell response and the Th17/IL-17 pathway modulates Th1 cell responses and contributes to pathology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serum antibody to Helicobacter pylori is tested in mass screening for gastric cancer along with the level of serum pepsinogens (PG) I and II. Recently, stool antigen tests have been developed as a new non-invasive test. We examined H. pylori infection by both serology and stool antigen test in a mass survey and compared the results to estimate applicability of stool antigen test for mass survey. METHODS: A total of 994 healthy adults who received mass survey in April 2005 were tested. There were 379 men and 615 women, and the mean age was 57.7 years old. Stool samples were used to measure a H. pylori-specific antigen by enzyme immunoassay. Serum samples were tested for the prevalence of IgG antibody to H. pylori, and the level of PGs I and II was also measured to determine the presence of atrophic gastritis. RESULTS: Infection of H. pylori was defined as positive 61.4\% and 56.4\% by serology and stool antigen test, respectively. The concordance of both tests was not affected by gender and age of the subjects but difference was seen in subjects with atrophic gastritis. In particular, positivity of stool antigen test (81.8\%) was significantly lower than that of serology (88.7\%, p {$<$} .05) in 303 subjects with severe atrophic gastritis. CONCLUSIONS: Stool antigen test, which detects present but not previous infection of H. pylori, would be applicable to diagnose H. pylori infection in mass survey. Usefulness of stool antigen tests for the screening of gastric cancer should be examined.},

Two types of SATs exist for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection, one based on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and another on immunochromatography (ICA). SATs do not require expensive chemical agents or specified equipment; hence, they are less expensive compared with the urea breath test. Both European and Japanese guidelines have shown that EIA-based SATs using monoclonal antibodies are useful for primary diagnosis as well as for the assessment of eradication therapy. ICA-based tests do not require particular equipment and are therefore useful in developing countries. SATs are also useful for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection in children and post gastric surgery patients. SATs performed via EIA can assess H. pylori infection in a large number of subjects, almost as well as serology. Thus, SATs would be useful or detecting current infection in such a survey to identify and eradicate H. pylori infection. The accuracy of SATs is lower when the stool samples are unformed or watery, because H. pylori-specific antigens in the stool samples are diluted. Temperature and the interval between stool sample collection and measurement also affect the results of SATs. The choice of test kit depends on the sensitivity and specificity in each region and the circumstances of each patient.},

IFNAR-dependent inhibition of an intracellular translational isoform of Osteopontin, termed Opn-i, derepressed interleukin-27 (IL-27) secretion and prevented efficient Th17 responses. Moreover, Opn-i expression in DC and microglia regulated the type and intensity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mice containing DC deficient in Opn-i produced excessive amounts of IL-27 and developed a delayed disease characterized by an enhanced Th1 response compared with the dominant Th17 response of Opn-sufficient mice. Definition of the IFNAR-Opn-i axis that controls Th17 development provides insight into regulation of Th cell sublineage development and the molecular basis of type I interferon therapy for MS and other autoimmune diseases.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is linked to various gastroduodenal diseases; however, only a small fraction of these patients develop associated diseases. Despite the high prevalence of H.\,pylori infection in Africa and South Asia, the incidence of gastric cancer in these areas is much lower than those in other countries. The incidence of gastric cancer tends to decrease from north to south in East Asia. Such geographical differences in the pathology can be explained, at least in part, by the presence of different types of H.\,pylori virulence factors in addition to host and environmental factors. Virulence factors of H.\,pylori, such as CagA, VacA, DupA, IceA, OipA and BabA, have been demonstrated to be the predictors of severe clinical outcomes. Interestingly, a meta-analysis showed that CagA seropositivity was associated with gastric cancer compared with gastritis, even in East Asian countries where almost the strains possess cagA. Another meta-analysis also confirmed the significance of vacA, dupA and iceA. However, it is possible that additional important pathogenic genes may exist because H.\,pylori consists of approximately 1600 genes. Despite the advances in our understanding of the development of H.\,pylori infection-related diseases, further work is required to clarify the roles of H.\,pylori virulence factors.},

Human p19 and p40 subunits were cloned and coexpressed in N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-negative 293S cells, which produce high-mannose-type glycosylated proteins in order to diminish the heterogeneity of modified N-linked glycans. The glycosylated human IL-23 was purified and crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. X-ray diffraction data were then collected to 2.6 \AA{} resolution.

Subtypes are differentiated by lineage, tissue, marker expression and function. Their function in promoting regulatory T cells in the gut to maintain immunologic homeostasis is well documented, but their role in the Helicobacter pylori-infected stomach is less clear. Some analyses of bone marrow-derived DCs stimulated with H. pylori have demonstrated proinflammatory potential based on secretion of IL-12 or IL-23 or activation of Th1 and Th17 cells. Other analyses indicate that H. pylori-activated DCs are less responsive compared with other gastrointestinal bacteria and activate DCs to promote Treg development. DC depletion in mice supports a role for DCs in down-regulating H. pylori-induced gastritis. These data indicate that gastric DCs recognize H. pylori much like DCs in the gut that recognize commensal organisms and promote a regulatory T-cell response. This is consistent with a growing body of literature documenting the prevalence and function of Treg cells in the host response to H. pylori. Research is now focused on characterizing how H. pylori induces such activity in DCs and identifying the mechanisms by which H. pylori-activated DCs activate Treg cells.},

  abstract = {Crohn's disease is an immune-mediated disease that is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation. Effector CD4+ T-lymphocytes are expanded in Crohn's disease-associated inflammatory lesions and play a critical role in the pathogenesis of this condition. Recently, a novel population of effector T-lymphocytes has been identified, which is clearly separated from the traditional Th1 and Th2 lineages and is characterized by the secretion of IL-17, hence its designation as Th17. The development of this population has been closely linked to IL-23, a member of the IL-12 family of cytokines. Converging lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the IL-23/Th17 axis is of pathogenic relevance for Crohn's disease. Protein and mRNA levels of IL-23, IL-17, and other Th17 effector cytokines, such as IL-21 and IL-22, are elevated in areas with active Crohn's disease-related inflammation, whereas lamina propria mononuclear cells from patients with Crohn's disease secrete increased amounts of IL-17 upon T-cell receptor-specific stimulation. Genome-wide association studies have identified several Crohn's disease-associated polymorphisms in genes that encode for proteins of the IL-23/Th17 pathway. Functional studies have shown that Th17-related effector cytokines induce pro-inflammatory responses that are components of the pathogenetic mechanisms of Crohn's disease, including recruitment of neutrophils via IL-8 induction, upregulation of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-1{$\beta$}, and IL-6, and secretion of metalloproteinases by intestinal fibroblasts. Finally, in several animal models of intestinal inflammation, disease severity is ameliorated when the IL-23/Th17 pathway is rendered deficient. These findings point to a critically important role for IL-23/Th17-mediated immune responses in Crohn's disease pathogenesis and may offer unique therapeutic opportunities for patients.},

  abstract = {Most studies investigating the function of IL-23 have concluded that it promotes IL-17-secreting T cells. Although some reports have also characterized IL-23 as having redundant pro-inflammatory effects with IL-12, we have instead found that IL-23 antagonizes IL-12-induced secretion of IFN-{$\gamma$}. When splenocytes or purified populations of T cells were cultured with IL-23, IFN-{$\gamma$} secretion in response to IL-12 was dramatically reduced. The impact of IL-23 was most prominent in CD8(+) T cells, but was also observed in NK and CD4(+) T cells. Mechanistically, the IL-23 receptor was not required for this phenomenon, and IL-23 inhibited signaling through the IL-12 receptor by reducing IL-12-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) phosphorylation. IL-23 was also able to reduce IFN-{$\gamma$} secretion by antagonizing endogenously produced IL-12 from Listeria monocytogenes (LM)-infected macrophages. In vivo, LM infection induced higher serum IFN-{$\gamma$} levels and a greater percentage of IFN-{$\gamma$}(+)CD8(+) T cells in IL-23p19-deficient mice as compared with WT mice. This increase in IFN-{$\gamma$} production coincided with increased LM clearance at days 2 and 3 post-infection. Our data suggest that IL-23 may be a key factor in determining the responsiveness of lymphocytes to IL-12 and their subsequent secretion of IFN-{$\gamma$}.},

PCR using urine is sensitive enough to diagnose human visceral leishmaniasis (VL). However, DNA quality is a crucial factor for successful amplification. METHODS: A comparative performance evaluation of DNA extraction methods from the urine of patients with VL using two commercially available extraction kits and two phenol-chloroform protocols was conducted to determine which method produces the highest quality DNA suitable for PCR amplification, as well as the most sensitive, fast and inexpensive method. All commercially available kits were able to shorten the duration of DNA extraction. RESULTS: With regard to detection limits, both phenol: chloroform extraction and the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit provided good results (0.1 pg of DNA) for the extraction of DNA from a parasite smaller than Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum ({$<$} 100fg of DNA). However, among 11 urine samples from subjects with VL, better performance was achieved with the phenol:chloroform method (8/11) relative to the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (4/11), with a greater number of positive samples detected at a lower cost using PCR. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that phenol:chloroform with an ethanol precipitation prior to extraction is the most efficient method in terms of yield and cost, using urine as a non-invasive source of DNA and providing an alternative diagnostic method at a low cost.},

METHODS: A total of 60 subjects having peptic ulcer diseases were tested for the detection of H. pylori using rapid urease test (RUT), histology, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in their antral biopsy specimens. A newly designed Hsp60 gene-based primer set was evaluated against commonly used PCR primers for detection of H. pylori. RESULTS: Forty-six of the 60 study subjects were found positive for culture isolation and all the 46 culture-positive specimens were also positive with Hsp60 gene PCR. Of the 46 culture-positive specimens, 44 were positive for 16S rRNA gene, ureC gene, RUT, and histology whereas only 29 were positive with ureA gene PCR. Of the 14 culture-negative subjects, 10 were positive with 16S rRNA gene, 4 were positive with ureC (glmM) gene PCR, and 2 were positive with RUT and 1 was positive on histology. CONCLUSION: This study shows that nested amplification targeting Hsp60 gene is the most sensitive and specific with LR+ and LR- values of proportional, variant and 0, respectively, when compared with the other three PCR methods. Also, HSP60 gene-specific nested protocol was the most appropriate for detection of H. pylori in clinical specimens. This is particularly valuable because it can be used as a noninvasive method for detecting H. pylori infection in young children and also, in follow-up studies with peptic ulcer patients, on samples like feces and saliva.},

  abstract = {Biopsy sampling of gastric mucosa at diagnostic endoscopy provides information that cannot be obtained by other means. The most common indication for gastric biopsy is the need to know whether or not the patient is infected with Helicobacter pylori, and whether the stomach is gastritic or not. Microscopic examination of gastric biopsy specimens, in addition to H. pylori status, provides information about the grade, extent, and topography of gastritis-related and atrophy-related lesions in the stomach. This information provides further opportunities for assessing the risk and likelihood of various gastric disorders. These are: a) The predominance or restriction of the H. pylori-related gastritis in the antrum strongly correlates with an increased risk of peptic ulcer disease, and of duodenal ulcer in particular (the duodenal ulcer phenotype of gastritis). b) The presence of atrophic gastritis (loss of normal glands) in the area of the gastric body indicates a low risk of ulcer and also a reduction in the capacity of the patient to secrete acid. c) The occurrence of advanced atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia multifocally in the stomach (advanced multifocal atrophic gastritis), and in the lesser curvature and angular notch in particular, are features suggestive of an increased risk of gastric neoplasias (the gastric cancer phenotype of gastritis). d) The presence of normal and healthy gastric mucosa indicates, on the other hand, an extremely low risk of both peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. In addition to diagnosis of H. pylori-related gastritic lesions, routine gastric biopsies may reveal findings that indicate special forms of gastritis, such as eosinophilic, lymphocytic, reactive, or granulomatous gastritis (e.g., Crohn's gastritis), or Helicobacter heilmannii gastritis. These types of gastritis can be found incidentally in a small percentage of patients who undergo diagnostic gastroscopy for abdominal complaints.},

Modern aspects of its classification and knowledge of its biological course and consequences were relatively well known even at the time that Helicobcter pylori was discovered by Robin Warren and Barry Marshall in 1982. This discovery, however, significantly changed the field, establishing that the commonest form of gastritis is simply an infectious disease, a finding that raised enormous interest in the subject amongst gastroenterologists, microbiologists, pathologists and basic researchers. However, many of these "new" players in the field often had a limited knowledge of the morphological aspects of gastric inflammations and chronic gastritis. As a consequence in the late 1980's a Working Party was set up to review the biology and natural course of chronic gastritis, to propose a new classification for gastritis, and to provide simple guidelines for reporting the pathology of gastritis in endoscopic biopsies in an attempt to bring uniformity to the subject and facilitate comparative studies in what was to be an era of high research activity. These guidelines, The Sydney System: A New Classification of Gastritis was presented to the World Congress of Gastroenterology in Sydney in 1990, and was later published as six papers in the Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology. Now, twenty years on, this review looks back on the birth of Sydney System and why it is still important and successful.},

In mice, mucosal vaccination with H. pylori antigens when given together with cholera toxin (CT) adjuvant, but not without adjuvant, can induce protective immune responses against H. pylori infection. However, the toxicity of CT precludes its use as a mucosal adjuvant in humans. We evaluated a recently developed, essentially nontoxic double mutant Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin, LT(R192G/L211A) (dmLT), as a mucosal adjuvant in an experimental H. pylori vaccine and compared it to CT in promoting immune responses and protection against H. pylori infection in mice. Immunization via the sublingual or intragastric route with H. pylori lysate antigens and dmLT resulted in a significant decrease in bacterial load after challenge compared to that in unimmunized infection controls and to the same extent as when using CT as an adjuvant. Cellular immune responses in the sublingually immunized mice known to correlate with protection were also fully comparable when using dmLT and CT as adjuvants, resulting in enhanced in vitro proliferative and cytokine responses from spleen and mesenteric lymph node cells to H. pylori antigens. Our results suggest that dmLT is an attractive adjuvant for inclusion in a mucosal vaccine against H. pylori infection.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori colonizes the mucus niche of the gastric mucosa and is a risk factor for gastritis, ulcers and cancer. The main components of the mucus layer are heavily glycosylated mucins, to which H. pylori can adhere. Mucin glycosylation differs between individuals and changes during disease. Here we have examined the H. pylori response to purified mucins from a range of tumor and normal human gastric tissue samples. Our results demonstrate that mucins from different individuals differ in how they modulate both proliferation and gene expression of H. pylori. The mucin effect on proliferation varied significantly between samples, and ranged from stimulatory to inhibitory, depending on the type of mucins and the ability of the mucins to bind to H. pylori. Tumor-derived mucins and mucins from the surface mucosa had potential to stimulate proliferation, while gland-derived mucins tended to inhibit proliferation and mucins from healthy uninfected individuals showed little effect. Artificial glycoconjugates containing H. pylori ligands also modulated H. pylori proliferation, albeit to a lesser degree than human mucins. Expression of genes important for the pathogenicity of H. pylori (babA, sabA, cagA, flaA and ureA) appeared co-regulated in response to mucins. The addition of mucins to co-cultures of H. pylori and gastric epithelial cells protected the viability of the cells and modulated the cytokine production in a manner that differed between individuals, was partially dependent of adhesion of H. pylori to the gastric cells, but also revealed that other mucin factors in addition to adhesion are important for H. pylori-induced host signaling. The combined data reveal host-specific effects on proliferation, gene expression and virulence of H. pylori due to the gastric mucin environment, demonstrating a dynamic interplay between the bacterium and its host.},

  abstract = {The HtrA proteases degrade damaged proteins and thus control the quality of proteins and protect cells against the consequences of various stresses; they also recognize specific protein substrates and in this way participate in regulation of many pathways. In many pathogenic bacteria strains lacking the HtrA function lose virulence or their virulence is decreased. This is due to an increased vulnerability of bacteria to stresses or to a decrease in secretion of virulence factors. In some cases HtrA is secreted outside the cell, where it promotes the pathogen's invasiveness. Thus, the HtrA proteases of bacterial pathogens are attractive targets for new therapeutic approaches aimed at inhibiting their proteolytic activity. The exported HtrAs are considered as especially promising targets for chemical inhibitors. In this review, we characterize the model prokaryotic HtrAs and HtrAs of pathogenic bacteria, focusing on their role in virulence. In humans HtrA1, HtrA2(Omi) and HtrA3 are best characterized. We describe their role in promoting cell death in stress conditions and present evidence indicating that HtrA1 and HtrA2 function as tumor suppressors, while HtrA2 stimulates cancer cell death induced by chemotherapeutic agents. We characterize the HtrA2 involvement in pathogenesis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and briefly describe the involvement of human HtrAs in other diseases. We hypothesize that stimulation of the HtrA's proteolytic activity might be beneficial in therapies of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, and discuss the possibilities of modulating HtrA proteolytic activity considering the present knowledge about their structure and regulation.},

IL-17A-producing cells are found in the double negative DN1 compartment of the Rag1(-/-) thymus and express intracellular CD3.

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric carcinoma. Gastric epithelial cells provide the first point of contact between H. pylori and the host. TLRs present on these cells recognize various microbial products, resulting in the initiation of innate immunity. Although previous reports investigated TLR signaling in response to intact H. pylori, the specific contribution of H. pylori LPS with regard to functional genomics and cell-signaling events has not been defined. This study set out to define downstream signaling components and altered gene expression triggered by H. pylori LPS and to investigate the role of the signaling protein tribbles 3 (TRIB3) during the TLR-mediated response to H. pylori LPS. Cotransfections using small interfering RNA and dominant-negative constructs demonstrated that H. pylori LPS functions as a classic TLR2 ligand by signaling through pathways involving the key TLR signaling components MyD88 adaptor-like, MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK4, TNFR-associated factor 6, I{$\kappa$}B kinase {$\beta$}, and I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$}. Microarray analysis, real-time PCR, and ELISA revealed the induction of a discrete pattern of chemokines as a direct effect of LPS:TLR2 signaling. H. pylori infection was associated with decreased expression of TRIB3 in human gastric epithelial cell lines and tissue samples. Additionally, H. pylori decreased expression of C/EBP homologous protein and activating transcription factor 4, the transcription factors involved in the induction of TRIB3 expression. Furthermore, knockdown of TRIB3 and C/EBP homologous protein enhanced TLR2-mediated NF-{$\kappa$}B activation and chemokine induction in response to H. pylori LPS. Thus, modulation of TRIB3 by H. pylori and/or its products may be an important mechanism during H. pylori-associated pathogenesis.},

None of the Gram-positive bacteria (GpB) primed for Th1 or Th2 development. In contrast, despite the low levels of IL-12 they induce, all Gram-negative bacteria (GnB) primed moDC for enhanced Th1 cell development, which was dependent on IL-12 and an additional unidentified cofactor. Strikingly, GnB-matured moDC expressed elevated levels of p19 and p28 mRNA, the critical subunits of IL-23 and IL-27, respectively, suggesting that the IL-12 family members may jointly be responsible for their Th1-driving capacity. Purified major cell wall components of either GnB or GpB did not yield Th cell profiles identical to those obtained with whole bacteria, and could not explain the induction of the IL-12 family members nor Th1 priming by GnB. Importantly, this study gives indications that the expression of the different IL-12 family members is dictated by different priming conditions of immature DC.},

Monkeys raised from birth and documented to be free of H. pylori were vaccinated with orogastric (n = 4) or intramuscular (n = 5) urease. Two control monkeys were sham vaccinated. All monkeys were challenged with a rhesus monkey-derived strain of H. pylori, and the effects of vaccination were evaluated by use of quantitative cultures of gastric tissue, histology, and measurement of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and salivary IgA. Despite a humoral immune response, all monkeys were infected after H. pylori challenge, and there were no differences in the density of colonization. Immunization with urease therefore does not fully protect against challenge with H. pylori. An effective vaccine to prevent H. pylori infection will require different or more likely additional antigens, as well as improvements in the stimulation of the host immune response.},

In this study, we report that macrophages rather than Th17 cells are the main producer of IL-17 in allergic inflammation related to asthma. After OVA challenge in a mouse model mimicking allergic asthma, the increased IL-17(+) cells in the lung were mainly CD11b(+)F4/80(+) macrophages, instead of T cells or others. Importantly, IL-17(+) alveolar macrophages (AMs), but not IL-17(+) interstitial macrophages, were significantly increased after allergen challenge. The increase of IL-17(+) AMs was not due to the influx of IL-17(+) macrophages from circulation or other tissues, but ascribed to the activation of AMs by mediator(s) secreted by IgE/OVA-activated mast cells. Depleting alveolar macrophages or neutralizing IL-17 prevented the initiation of OVA-induced asthma-related inflammation by inhibiting the increase of inflammatory cells and inflammatory factors in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Th2 cytokine IL-10 could down-regulate IL-17 expression in alveolar macrophages. The increased IL-17 and the decreased IL-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were further confirmed in asthmatic patients. These findings suggest that IL-17 is mainly produced by macrophages but not Th17 cells in allergic inflammation related to asthma. Mast cell-released mediators up-regulate the expression of IL-17 by macrophages, whereas IL-10 down-regulates IL-17 expression.},

Chronic Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection can induce an inflammatory response that promotes atrophic gastritis, a preceding event to cancer development. The type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells have recently emerged as a critical participant in maintaining self-tolerance. In this study, we examined Tr1 cells in H. pylori infection and gastric cancer development. While H. pylori-uninfected (uninfected) subjects presented low Tr1 frequency in the peripheral blood, H. pylori-infected asymptomatic (infected) individuals and H. pylori-infected gastric cancer (cancer) individuals both presented elevated Tr1 frequency. Although the Tr1 cells from infected asymptomatic subjects were functionally more potent than those from uninfected healthy subjects, the Tr1 cells in cancer individuals demonstrated several functional impairments, such as reduced interleukin 10 (IL-10) expression, lower secretion of cytolytic factors including granzyme B and perforin, and lower capacity to suppress CD4+CD25- T cell and CD8+ T cell proliferation. In addition, the frequency and function of Tr1 cells were positively correlated with the disease-free survival of the gastric cancer patients. These results suggest that Tr1 cells might be involved in the regulating immune responses in H. pylori infection and gastric cancer development. The fact that Tr1 cells could suppress inflammation and produce cytotoxic molecules at the same time has made them attractive potential candidates for future immunotherapies.},

RESULTS: H pylori infection, chronic active gastritis, and intestinal metaplasia had similar epidemiologic patterns. The presence of each, based on histology analyses, was significantly associated with that of the others. They were also characterized by similar geographic distributions within the United States. All 3 disorders were more common among men and among Medicaid patients (compared with those with other insurance) and were inversely associated with Barrett's metaplasia (less frequent in patients with Barrett's metaplasia).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The long-term time trends of multiple gastrointestinal diseases are characterised by a striking rise and fall. These temporal changes provide important clues about disease aetiology. AIM: To highlight the importance of Helicobacter pylori infection in shaping the temporal trends of many common gastrointestinal diseases. METHODS: Literature review of the time trends associated with common digestive diseases. RESULTS: The general trends of gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, rectum cancer have all been shaped by a similar underlying birth-cohort phenomenon. Mortality associated with these diagnoses increased in all generations born during the nineteenth century. It peaked among generations born shortly before the turn of the century and then decreased in all subsequent generations born throughout the twentieth century. These patterns can be observed in the incidence, hospitalisation and mortality data from many different countries. They reflect similar rising and falling trends of H. pylori infection in the general population. Diseases that are inversely associated with H. pylori, such as reflux disease, erosive oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus, and oesophageal adenocarcinoma, have seen a striking rise during the recent decline of H. pylori infection. CONCLUSION: The temporal variations of H. pylori infection have affected the occurrence of gastroenterology's most common disorders.},

At low doses (75-325 mg daily), aspirin is the key antiplatelet drug in the pharmacological prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Topical and systemic effects of aspirin in the gastrointestinal mucosa are associated with mucosal damage in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. The risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin is increased with old age, male sex, ulcer history and concomitant medication with NSAIDs, cyclooxygenase 2 selective inhibitors, corticosteroids or other antithrombotic agents. In some patients, the cardiovascular benefits of low-dose aspirin might be overcome by the risk of gastrointestinal complications, but withdrawal of aspirin therapy can precipitate a cardiovascular event. These patients will need concomitant therapy with antisecretory agents, especially PPIs, to reduce the gastrointestinal risk. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection might be an additional option in patients with a history of ulcer. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that long-term use of aspirin decreases the risk of colorectal cancer, even at low doses. As aspirin is one of the most prescribed drugs worldwide and its clinical impact is huge, physicians need to consider the benefits and harms for each individual patient in order to maximize the benefits of aspirin.},

In this study we aim to test the safety and adjuvant efficacy of LT delivered rectally together with recombinant H. pylori urease. Eighteen healthy adults without present or past H. pylori infection were enrolled in a double blind, randomized, ascending dose study to receive either urease (60 mg), or urease (60 mg) + LT (5 or 25 microg). The immunization preparation was administered per rectum on days 0, 14 and 28. Serum, stool and saliva anti-urease and anti-LT IgG and IgA antibodies (Abs) were measured and urease-specific and LT-specific antigen secreting cells (ASCs) were counted in peripheral blood at baseline and 7 (ASC counts) or 14 days (antibody levels) after each dosing. Peripheral blood lymphoproliferation assays were also performed at baseline and at the end of the study. Rectally delivered urease and LT were well tolerated. Among the 12 subjects assigned to urease+LT, 2 (16.7\%) developed anti-urease IgG Abs, 1 (8.3\%) developed anti-urease IgA Abs, and 3 (25\%) showed urease-specific IgA(+) ASCs. Immune responses to LT were more vigorous, especially in subjects exposed to 5 microg LT. In the urease+ 5 microg LT group, anti-LT IgG and IgA Abs developed in 60 and 80\% of the subjects, respectively, while LT-specific IgG(+) and IgA(+) ASCs were detected in all subjects. The magnitude of the anti-LT response was much higher than the response to urease. No IgA anti-urease or anti-LT Abs were detected in stool or saliva and lymphocyte proliferative responses to urease were unsatisfactory. In conclusion, rectal delivery of 5 microg LT is safe and induces vigorous systemic anti-LT immune responses. Further studies are needed to determine if LT can be an effective adjuvant for rectally delivered antigens.},

  abstract = {The main extracellular matrix binding component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, {$\alpha$}-dystroglycan ({$\alpha$}-DG), which was originally isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle, is an extensively O-glycosylated protein. Previous studies have shown {$\alpha$}-DG to be modified by both O-GalNAc- and O-mannose-initiated glycan structures. O-Mannosylation, which accounts for up to 30\% of the reported O-linked structures in certain tissues, has been rarely observed on mammalian proteins. Mutations in multiple genes encoding defined or putative glycosyltransferases involved in O-mannosylation are causal for various forms of congenital muscular dystrophy. Here, we explore the glycosylation of purified rabbit skeletal muscle {$\alpha$}-DG in detail. Using tandem mass spectrometry approaches, we identify 4 O-mannose-initiated and 17 O-GalNAc-initiated structures on {$\alpha$}-DG isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of tandem mass spectrometry-based workflows to directly analyze glycopeptides generated from the purified protein. By combining glycomics and tandem mass spectrometry analysis of 91 glycopeptides from {$\alpha$}-DG, we were able to assign 21 different residues as being modified by O-glycosylation with differing degrees of microheterogeneity; 9 sites of O-mannosylation and 14 sites of O-GalNAcylation were observed with only two sites definitively exhibiting occupancy by either type of glycan. The distribution of identified sites of O-mannosylation suggests a limited role for local primary sequence in dictating sites of attachment.},

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS) is used to quantify the relative distribution of glycans attached to particular protein glycosylation sites (micro-heterogeneity) and evaluate the molar site occupancy (macro-heterogeneity) in glycoproteomics. However, the accuracy of MS for such quantitative measurements remains to be clarified. As a key step towards this goal, a panel of related tryptic peptides with and without complex, biantennary, disialylated N-glycans was chemically synthesised by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Peptides mimicking those resulting from enzymatic deglycosylation using PNGase F/A and endo D/F/H were synthetically produced, carrying aspartic acid and N-acetylglucosamine-linked asparagine residues, respectively, at the glycosylation site. The MS ionisation/detection strengths of these pure, well-defined and quantified compounds were investigated using various MS ionisation techniques and mass analysers (ESI-IT, ESI-Q-TOF, MALDI-TOF, ESI/MALDI-FT-ICR-MS). Depending on the ion source/mass analyser, glycopeptides carrying complex-type N-glycans exhibited clearly lower signal strengths (10-50\% of an unglycosylated peptide) when equimolar amounts were analysed. Less ionisation/detection bias was observed when the glycopeptides were analysed by nano-ESI and medium-pressure MALDI. The position of the glycosylation site within the tryptic peptides also influenced the signal response, in particular if detected as singly or doubly charged signals. This is the first study to systematically and quantitatively address and determine MS glycopeptide ionisation/detection strengths to evaluate glycoprotein micro-heterogeneity and macro-heterogeneity by label-free approaches. These data form a much needed knowledge base for accurate quantitative glycoproteomics. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

While several types of glycosylation can be predicted by the protein sequence context, and substantial knowledge of these glycoproteomes is available, our knowledge of the GalNAc-type O-glycosylation is highly limited. This type of glycosylation is unique in being regulated by 20 polypeptide GalNAc-transferases attaching the initiating GalNAc monosaccharides to Ser and Thr (and likely some Tyr) residues. We have developed a genetic engineering approach using human cell lines to simplify O-glycosylation (SimpleCells) that enables proteome-wide discovery of O-glycan sites using 'bottom-up' ETD-based mass spectrometric analysis. We implemented this on 12 human cell lines from different organs, and present a first map of the human O-glycoproteome with almost 3000 glycosites in over 600 O-glycoproteins as well as an improved NetOGlyc4.0 model for prediction of O-glycosylation. The finding of unique subsets of O-glycoproteins in each cell line provides evidence that the O-glycoproteome is differentially regulated and dynamic. The greatly expanded view of the O-glycoproteome should facilitate the exploration of how site-specific O-glycosylation regulates protein function.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori colonizes the gastric mucosa of more than 50\% of the human population, causing chronic inflammation, which however is largely asymptomatic. Nevertheless, H. pylori-infected subjects can develop chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric cancer. Chronic exposure to the pathogen and its ability to induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the injection of cytotoxin-associated gene A into gastric epithelial cells may be key triggers of carcinogenesis. By deregulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions as well as DNA methylation, histone modifications, expression of micro RNAs, and resistance to apoptosis, EMT can actively contribute to early stages of the cancer formation. Host response to the infection significantly contributes to disease development and the concomitance of particular genotypes of both pathogen and host may turn into the most severe outcomes. T regulatory cells (Treg) have been recently demonstrated to play an important role in H. pylori-related disease development and at the same time the Treg-induced tolerance has been proposed as a possible mechanism that leads to less severe disease. Efficacy of antibiotic therapies of H. pylori infection has significantly dropped. Unfortunately, no vaccine against H. pylori is currently licensed, and protective immunity mechanisms against H. pylori are only partially understood. In spite of promising results obtained in animal models of infection with a number of vaccine candidates, few clinical trials have been conducted so far and with no satisfactory outcomes. However, prophylactic vaccination may be the only means to efficiently prevent H. pylori-associated cancers.},

It has previously been reported that cocultivation of epithelial cells with Helicobacter pylori triggers signal transduction and tyrosine phosphorylation of a 145-kDa putative host cell protein. Herein, we demonstrate that this protein is not derived from the host but rather is the bacterial immunodominant antigen CagA, a virulence factor commonly expressed in peptic ulcer disease and thought to be an orphan of a specific biological function. Thus, CagA is delivered into the epithelial cells by the cag type IV secretion system where it is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by an as yet unidentified host cell kinase and wired to eukaryotic signal transduction pathways and cytoskeletal plasticity.},

The research described here demonstrates that an additional antioxidant enzyme, thiolperoxidase (Tpx), is effective as a prophylactic vaccine antigen via both systemic and mucosal routes. The functional relationship between SOD, KatA and Tpx also provided an opportunity to investigate synergistic or additive effects when the three antigens were used in combination. Although the antigens still provided equivalent protection when administered in combination, no additional protection was observed. Moreover a decrease in antibody titres to the individual antigens was observed when delivered in combination via the nasal route, though not when injected subcutaneously.

The purification method, utilizing classical and high-performance liquid chromatographic techniques, yielded protein with a specific activity of 8.5 x 10(7) units/mg in a T-cell growth factor assay. Analysis of the purified protein by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that CLMF is a 75-kDa heterodimer composed of disulfide-bonded 40-kDa and 35-kDa subunits. Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the two subunits revealed that both subunits are not related to any previously identified cytokine. Purified CLMF stimulated the proliferation of human phytohemagglutinin-activated lymphoblasts by itself and exerted additive effects when used in combination with suboptimal amounts of interleukin 2. Furthermore, the purified protein was shown to synergize with low concentrations of interleukin 2 in causing the induction of lymphokine-activated killer cells.},

  abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), for many years almost exclusively studied by the pharmacology/toxicology field for its role in mediating the toxicity of xenobiotics such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), has more recently attracted the attention of immunologists. The evolutionary conservation of this transcription factor and its widespread expression in the immune system point to important physiological functions that are slowly being unraveled. In particular, the emphasis is now shifting from the role of AhR in the xenobiotic pathway toward its mode of action in response to physiological ligands. In this article, we review the current understanding of the molecular interactions and functions of AhR in the immune system in steady state and in the presence of infection and inflammation, with a focus on barrier organs such as the skin, the gut, and the lung.},

Since Th2 cytokines antagonize classically activated monocytes/macrophages by inducing alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs), we here assessed the effect of IL-25 on the alternative activation of human monocytes/macrophages. The interleukins IL-25, IL-4 and IL-13 were effective in reducing the expression of inflammatory chemokines in monocytes. This effect was paralleled by induction of AAMs in cultures added with IL-4 or IL-13 but not with IL-25, regardless of whether cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or interferon-{$\gamma$}. Moreover, pre-incubation of cells with IL-25 did not alter the ability of both IL-4 and IL-13 to induce AAMs. Both IL-4 and IL-13 activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), and silencing of this transcription factor markedly reduced the IL-4/IL-13-driven induction of AAMs. In contrast, IL-25 failed to trigger STAT6 activation. Among Th2 cytokines, only IL-25 and IL-10 were able to activate p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results collectively indicate that IL-25 fails to induce AAMs and that Th2-type cytokines suppress inflammatory responses in human monocytes by activating different intracellular signalling pathways.},

Forceps biopsy material obtained from 240 patients with NUD and H.p. gastritis (3 specimens from the antrum, 2 from the corpus) were investigated. The 5 histological parameters employed were graduated semiquantitatively as follows: 0 = normal findings, 1 = minimal, 2 = low-grade, 3 = medium-grade, 4 = high-grade. The evaluation showed that the degree and activity of gastritis, the degree of replacement of foveolar epithelium by regenerating epithelial cells, and the degree of mucus depletion are dependent upon the degree of H.p. colonisation (p {$<$} 0.0001). The gastritis parameters were more marked in the antrum than in the corpus. The intercorrelations were highly significant for all five parameters investigated, both in the antrum and corpus (p {$<$} 0.0001). On the basis of these results it is concluded that for the histological assessment of H.p. gastritis, in addition to H.p. colonisation, and the degree and activity of gastritis, but also the state of the foveolar epithelium and the mucus production of these epithelial cells should be considered.},

Of pathogenetic importance is, in the first instance, the differentiation between gastritis with and gastritis without H pylori infection. The group of H pylori-associated gastritis can be further subdivided into forms of gastritis whose morphological distribution patterns usually identify them as sequelae of H pylori infection, while the group of gastritis unassociated with H pylori, can be differentiated into autoimmune, chemically induced reactive gastritis, ex-H pylori gastritis, Helicobacter heilmannii gastritis, Crohn's gastritis and a number of special forms of gastritis.},

In vitro, treatment of naive primary T cells with IL-27 suppressed the development T(H)-17 cells induced by IL-6 and transforming growth factor-beta, which was dependent on the intracellular signaling molecule STAT1 but was independent of inhibition of IL-6 signaling mediated by the suppressor protein SOCS3.

Similarly, the ability to generate antibody responses was dependent on the activity of gp130-signaling cytokines.

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is one of the most common human pathogens. It causes chronic gastritis and is involved in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal ulcer disease and possibly gastric carcinoma. Helicobacter mustelae is a bacterium closely related to H. pylori that causes gastritis and ulcer disease in ferrets and is therefore considered an important animal model of gastric Helicobacter infections. Motility, even in a viscous environment, is conferred to the bacteria by several sheathed flagella and is regarded as one of their principal virulence factors. The flagellar filament of H. pylori consists of two different flagellin species expressed in different amounts. The gene (flaA) encoding the major flagellin has recently been cloned and sequenced. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of two highly homologous new flagellin genes from H. pylori 85P and H. mustelae NCTC 12032. The nucleotide sequence of the H. pylori gene proved that it encoded the second flagellin molecule found in H. pylori flagellar filaments. The genes were named flaB. The H. mustelae and H. pylori flaB genes both coded for proteins with 514 amino acids and molecular masses of 54.0 and 53.9 kDa, respectively. The proteins shared 81.7\% identical amino acids. The degree of conservation between H. pylori FlaB and the H. pylori FlaA major flagellin was much lower (58\%). Both flaB genes were preceded by sigma 54-like promoter sequences. Mapping of the transcription start site for the H. pylori flaB gene by a primer extension experiment confirmed the functional activity of the sigma 54 promoter. To evaluate the importance of both genes for motility, flaA- and flaB-disrupted mutants of H. pylori N6 were constructed by electroporation-mediated allelic exchange and characterized by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis and motility testing. Both mutations selectively abolished the expression of the targeted gene without affecting the synthesis of the other flagellin molecule. Whereas flaA mutants were completely nonmotile, flaB mutants retained motility.},

Comparisons with sequences from Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, and Drosophila melanogaster showed that recombination in H. pylori was much more frequent than in other species. In contrast, when multiple family members infected with H. pylori were investigated, some strains were indistinguishable at all three loci. Thus, H. pylori is clonal over short time periods after natural transmission.},

It was shown previously in Runx3-deficient mice that differentiation of CD8 T and NK cells is perturbed. In this study, we show that Runx3 is also required for proper differentiation and function of regulatory T cells. In Runx3-deficient mice, T cells were unable to inhibit inflammation and to suppress tumor development. As expected, recombination activating gene 2-deficient mice bearing Runx3-deficient lymphocytes spontaneously developed colon tumors. However, tumor formation was completely blocked by transfer of either regulatory T cells or CD8 T cells derived from wild-type mice to mutant mice or by housing mutant mice in a specific pathogen-free condition. These results indicate that Runx3-deficient lymphocytes and microorganisms act together to induce inflammation and consequently induce the development of colon tumors.},

Design Twenty-three clinical questions addressing the above-mentioned four domains were drafted for which expert panels were asked to formulate relevant statements. A Delphi method using an anonymous electronic system was adopted to develop the consensus, the level of which was predefined as {$\geq$}80\%. Final modifications of clinical questions and consensus were achieved at the face-to-face meeting in Kyoto. Results All 24 statements for 22 clinical questions after extensive modifications and omission of one clinical question were achieved with a consensus level of {$>$}80\%. To better organise classification of gastritis and duodenitis based on aetiology, a new classification of gastritis and duodenitis is recommended for the 11th international classification. A new category of H. pylori-associated dyspepsia together with a diagnostic algorithm was proposed. The adoption of grading systems for gastric cancer risk stratification, and modern image-enhancing endoscopy for the diagnosis of gastritis, were recommended. Treatment to eradicate H. pylori infection before preneoplastic changes develop, if feasible, was recommended to minimise the risk of more serious complications of the infection. Conclusions A global consensus for gastritis was developed for the first time, which will be the basis for an international classification system and for further research on the subject.},

The aim of this study was to clarify the chronological changes in cytokine levels in relation to several H. pylori outer membrane proteins. Methods: We studied Mongolian gerbils inoculated with wild-type H. pylori 7.13 for up to 48 weeks and then examined animals infected with oipA, babA, or alpAB isogenic mutants for 12 weeks. Mucosal IL-6 and IL-11 mRNA levels were measured using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Results: High levels of gastric mucosal IL-6 and IL-11 mRNA in gerbils infected with wild-type H. pylori were observed during the chronic phase of infection, reaching maximums at 12 and 6 months, respectively. Infection with oipA and babA mutants resulted in significantly reduced cytokine levels and inflammatory cell infiltrations compared to gerbils infected with wild-type strains, and this persisted throughout the observation period. The alpAB mutants did not infect gerbils. Mucosal IL-6 and IL-11 levels were significantly associated with the grade of inflammatory cell infiltration. Conclusions: OipA and BabA result in more severe H. pylori infection and increased IL-6 and IL-11 levels, which in turn may increase the risk of developing H. pylori-induced gastrointestinal diseases.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare published Helicobacter pylori primer pairs for their ability to reliably detect H. pylori in gastric biopsy specimens and salivary samples. Detection limits of the 26 PCR primer pairs previously described for detection of H. pylori DNA in clinical samples were determined. Sensitivity and specificity were determined using primers with detection limits of {$<$}100 CFU/ml using 50 H. pylori-positive and -negative (by concordance by culture and histology) coded gastric biopsy specimens. These results were then confirmed with gastric biopsy specimens and saliva from patients with confirmed H. pylori status. Five of the twenty-six previously reported primer pairs (HP64-f/HP64-r, HP1/HP2, EHC-U/EHC-L, VAG-F/VAG-R, and ICT37/ICT38) had detection limits of {$<$}100 CFU/ml in the presence of gastric tissue. None had 100\% specificity or sensitivity; all produced false-positive results. The HP64-f/HP64-r for ureA and HP1/HP2 for 16S rRNA individually had sensitivities and specificities of {$>$}90\% with gastric biopsy specimens. No combinations of primer pairs improved the results. Using these five primer pairs, 54\% of the positive saliva samples were determined to be false positive; both the HP64-f/HP64-r and the HP1/HP2 sets produced false positives with saliva. We conclude that clinicians should not rely on results using current PCR primers alone to decide the H. pylori status of an individual patient or as a basis for treatment decisions. The results of studies based on PCR identification of H. pylori in environmental samples should be viewed with caution. Possibly, specific primers sets can be identified based on the presence of multiple putative virulence factor genes.},

VacA blocks IL-2 secretion in transformed T cell lines by suppressing the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). In this study, we investigated the effects of VacA on primary human CD4(+) T cells. VacA inhibited the proliferation of primary human T cells activated through the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28. VacA-treated Jurkat T cells secreted markedly diminished levels of IL-2 compared with untreated cells, whereas VacA-treated primary human T cells continued to secrete high levels of IL-2. Further experiments indicated that the VacA-induced inhibition of primary human T cell proliferation was not attributable to VacA effects on NFAT activation or IL-2 secretion. We show here that VacA suppresses IL-2-induced cell-cycle progression and proliferation of primary human T cells without affecting IL-2-dependent survival. Through the analysis of a panel of mutant VacA proteins, we demonstrate that VacA-mediated inhibition of T cell proliferation requires an intact N-terminal hydrophobic region necessary for the formation of anion-selective membrane channels. Remarkably, we demonstrate that one of these mutant VacA proteins [VacA-Delta(6-27)] abrogates the immunosuppressive actions of wild-type VacA in a dominant-negative fashion. We suggest that VacA may inhibit the clonal expansion of T cells that have already been activated by H. pylori antigens, thereby allowing H. pylori to evade the adaptive immune response and establish chronic infection.},

METHODS: The alpA gene of Hp was amplified by PCR and cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pNICE: sec. The recombinant vector pNICE: sec-alpA was transformed into Lactococcus lactis strain NZ9000. Then the engineered strain was induced to express recombinant alpA as shown by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Female ICR mice (CV Grade) were randomly divided into 4 groups and administrated orally with PBS, L. lactis pNICE: sec, L. lactis pNICE: sec-alpA, and the inactivated Hp, respectively. After immunized seven times, the mice were detected for their alpA-specific IgG and IgA. RESULTS: The alpA gene was obtained and successfully cloned into the vector pNICE: sec. The recombinant alpA protein (56,000) was accumulated in L. lactis after the induction of the nisin, accounting for 9.6\% of the total bacterial protein. Western bolt confirmed that the alpA protein could be recognized specifically by the anti-Hp serum. The titer of anti-alpA IgG in the pNICE: sec-alpA group, comparable to that in the inactivated Hp group, was higher than that in the pNICE: sec group. The titer of anti-alpA IgA in the pNICE: sec-alpA group was higher than all other groups (P{$<$}0.05). CONCLUSION: The oral administration of the engineered alpA-expressing L. lactis induced protective immunity against Hp. Our study provides a certain experimental basis for the use of L. lactis as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of Hp oral vaccines.},

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent a class of transmembrane pattern recognition receptors essential for microbial recognition and control of the innate immune response. In this study, we examined the role of TLRs in mediating H. pylori tolerogenic programming of dendritic cells and their impact on anti-H. pylori immunity using C57BL/6 wild-type and TLR2-knockout (TLR2KO) mice. We analyzed the response of TLR2KO bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to H. pylori SS1 stimulation and the outcome of chronic H. pylori infection in TLR2KO mice. We showed that H. pylori-stimulated BMDCs upregulated the expression of TLR2, but not TLR4, TLR5, or TLR9. H. pylori-stimulated BMDCs from TLRKO mice induced lower Treg and Th17 responses, but a higher IFN-{$\gamma$} response compared to H. pylori-stimulated BMDCs from wild-type mice. In vivo analyses following an H. pylori infection of 2 months duration showed a lower degree of gastric H. pylori colonization in TLR2KO mice and more severe gastric immunopathology compared to WT mice. The gastric mucosa of the infected TLR2KO mice showed a lower mRNA expression of Foxp3, IL-10, and IL-17A, but higher expression of IFN-{$\gamma$} compared to the gastric mRNA expression in infected wild-type mice. Moreover, the H. pylori-specific Th1 response was higher and the Treg and Th17 responses were lower in the spleens of infected TLR2KO mice compared to infected WT mice. Our data indicate that H. pylori mediates immune tolerance through TLR2-derived signals and inhibits Th1 immunity, thus evading host defense. TLR2 may be an important target in the modulation of the host response to H. pylori.},

We therefore evaluated the protective efficacy of recombinant HpaA (rHpaA) as a candidate vaccine antigen against H. pylori. To explore the impact of genetic diversity, inbred and outbred mice were prophylactically and therapeutically immunized with rHpaA adjuvanted with cholera toxin (CT). Prophylactic immunization induced a reduction in bacterial colonization in BALB/c and QS mice, but was ineffective in C57BL/6 mice, despite induction of antigen-specific antibodies. By contrast, therapeutic immunization was effective in all three strains of mice. Prophylactic immunization with CT-adjuvanted rHpaA was more effective when delivered via the nasal route than following intragastric delivery in BALB/c mice. However, HpaA-mediated protection was inferior to that induced by bacterial lysate. Hence, protective efficacy is inducible with vaccines containing HpaA, most relevantly shown in an outbred population of mice. The effectiveness of protection induced by HpaA antigen was influenced by host genetics and was less effective than lysate. HpaA therefore has potential for the development of effective immunization against H. pylori but this would probably entail the antigen to be one component of a multiantigenic vaccine.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Helicobacter pylori is a major cause of peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. Vaccine development is progressing but there is concern that immunisation may exacerbate Helicobacter induced gastritis: prophylactic immunisation followed by challenge with H felis or H pylori can induce a more severe gastritis in mice than seen with infection alone. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between immunity to Helicobacter infection and post-immunisation gastritis. METHODS: (1) C57BL/6 mice were prophylactically immunised before challenge with either H felis or H pylori. Histopathology and colonisation were assessed one month post-challenge. (2) C57BL/6 mice were prophylactically immunised against H felis infection and gastritis assessed up to 18 months post-challenge. RESULTS: Prophylactic immunisation induced a reduction in bacterial colonisation following H felis challenge which was associated with increased severity of active gastritis with neutrophil infiltration and atrophy. However, immunised mice challenged with H pylori SS1 had little evidence of pathology. Long term follow up showed that post-immunisation gastritis was evident at three months. However, from six months onwards, although immunised/challenged mice still developed gastritis, there was no significant difference between inflammation in these mice and infected controls. Post-immunisation gastritis was not associated with the serum antibody response. Immunisation prevented the formation of secondary lymphoid aggregates in the gastric tissue. CONCLUSION: The H felis mouse model of post-immunisation gastritis is the most extreme example of this type of pathology. We have shown in this model that post-immunisation gastritis is a transient event which does not produce long term exacerbation of pathology.},

The majority of these cancers develop as a result of a chronic gastritis that arises in response to infection with the stomach-dwelling bacterium, Helicobacter pylori. A vaccine against this pathogen would therefore be a powerful tool for preventing gastric adenocarcinoma. However, notwithstanding a proof-of-concept that vaccination can protect children from acquisition of H. pylori infection, there are currently no advanced vaccine candidates with only a single vaccine in Phase I clinical trial. Further, the development of a vaccine against H. pylori is not a current strategic priority of major pharmaceutical companies despite the large global disease burden. Given the involvement of such companies is likely to be critical for late stage development, there is therefore a need for an increased appreciation of the burden of this disease in LMIC and more investment to reinvigorate research in H. pylori vaccine Research and Development.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is an important human pathogen. Prophylactic immunization with bacterial antigen plus an adjuvant protects mice against challenge with live H. pylori. Surprisingly, it was found that immunizations of mice already infected with Helicobacter also influenced bacterial colonization. This concept of therapeutic immunization is a novel phenomenon. Because H. pylori lives in the lumen of the stomach, it was initially hypothesized that the protective mechanism would involve induction of secretory IgA. However, work with knockout mice has demonstrated that prophylactic immunization is equally effective in mice deficient in IgA and even in microMT mice lacking B lymphocytes. Currently nothing is known about therapeutic vaccination and the effect of immunizing a host with an ongoing ineffective immune response. To address this, we infected B-cell deficient, microMT mice with H. pylori and therapeutically immunized them four times in 3 weeks with bacterial sonicate and cholera toxin adjuvant. These immunizations significantly reduced colonization by H. pylori. The antibody- negative status of the microMT mice was confirmed by ELISA. Thus, therapeutic immunization stimulates an immune response, which reduces H. pylori infection via a mechanism that is antibody independent. How this is achieved remains to be determined, but may well involve a novel immune mechanism.},

  abstract = {Back to TopAbstract The developmental commitment to a T helper 1 (Th1)- or Th2-type response can significantly influence host immunity to pathogens. Extinction of the IL-12 signaling pathway during early Th2 development provides a mechanism that allows stable phenotype commitment. In this report we demonstrate that extinction of IL-12 signaling in early Th2 cells results from a selective loss of IL-12 receptor (IL-12R) {$\beta$}2 subunit expression. To determine the basis for this selective loss, we examined IL-12R {$\beta$}2 subunit expression during Th cell development in response to T cell treatment with different cytokines. IL-12R {$\beta$}2 is not expressed by naive resting CD4+ T cells, but is induced upon antigen activation through the T cell receptor. Importantly, IL-4 and IFN-{$\gamma$} were found to significantly modify IL-12 receptor {$\beta$}2 expression after T cell activation. IL-4 inhibited IL-12R {$\beta$}2 expression leading to the loss of IL-12 signaling, providing an important point of regulation to promote commitment to the Th2 pathway. IFN-{$\gamma$} treatment of early developing Th2 cells maintained IL-12R {$\beta$}2 expression and restored the ability of these cells to functionally respond to IL-12, but did not directly inhibit IL-4 or induce IFN-{$\gamma$} production. Thus, IFN-{$\gamma$} may prevent early Th cells from premature commitment to the Th2 pathway. Controlling the expression of the IL-12R {$\beta$}2 subunit could be an important therapeutic target for the redirection of ongoing Th cell responses.},

The association takes place at 37\textdegree C within 5 min and is stable for at least 40 min in the presence of IL-6, but does not occur at 0\textdegree C. Human IL-6-R can associate with a murine gp130 homolog and is functional in murine cells. Mutant IL-6-R lacking the intracytoplasmic portion is functional, suggesting that the two polypeptide chains interact to involve their extracellular portion. In fact, a soluble IL-6-R lacking the transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains can associate with gp130 in the presence of IL-6 and mediate its function. These findings indicate that the complex of IL-6 and IL-6-R can interact with a non-ligand-binding membrane glycoprotein, gp130, extracellularly and can provide the IL-6 signal.},

Establishment of persistent phenotype of Th17 cells and recognition of lineage-deviating factors are of most attractive goals in modern researches in immunology. Although IL-6 and TGF-{$\beta$} are frequently used to differentiate naive T cells to Th17 phenotype in mouse models, the application of IL-23 and its importance in preventing cells from plasticity needs to be more investigated. Our main objective was to evaluate the role of IL-23 in Th17 to Th1 plasticity. In this research project, we generated in vitro Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-specific Th17 cells in the presence of TGF-{$\beta$}, IL-6, IL-23 and peptide MOG35-55. Th17 development was confirmed by assessment of relevant transcription factors and secreted cytokines by flowcytometry and ELISA, respectively. Th17 to Th1 plasticity was monitored by consecutive samplings in different time points without any extra supplementation of IL-23. Cell culture supernatant was evaluated for Interferon (IFN)-{$\gamma$} secretion and cells were evaluated for intracellular expression of this cytokine. Our results showed that the employed method was relatively convenient in developing antigen-specific Th17 cells. We also showed that IL-23 deprivation which happens by prolongation of culture period, can convert IL-17 producing cells to IFN-{$\gamma$} secreting Th1 phenotype. IL-23 can be considered as a Th17 phenotype stabilizing factor for in-vitro developed lineages.},

Here, we demonstrate that interleukin (IL)-17, a proinflammatory cytokine known to be produced mainly by activated T cells, has a critical role in this process. Antiserum against IL-17 or deletion of Il17r protected mice against a lethal TNF challenge. Serum levels of TNF-induced IL-6 and nitric oxide metabolites were significantly reduced in mice deficient in the IL-17R. TNF-induced leukocyte influx in the small intestine was reduced, and there was no injury to the small intestine. Surprisingly, electron microscopy showed that IL-17 was constitutively present in Paneth cells of the crypts. Upon TNF challenge, the intracellular pool of IL-17 in these cells was drastically reduced, suggesting rapid release of IL-17 from the granules of Paneth cells. Our findings assign a novel role for IL-17 in an acute inflammation and identify Paneth cells as a source of the IL-17 that plays a role in this process. These data indicate that innate immune cytokine responses in the local mucosa may participate in rapidly amplifying responses to systemic inflammatory challenges.},

In addition, full-sequenced data revealed that dupA has two types with different lengths depend on the presence of approximately 600 bp in the putative 5' region (presence; long-type and absence; short-type), which has not been taken into account in previous studies. METHODS: A total of 319 strains isolated from Okinawa, the south islands of Japan, were included. The status of dupA and cagA was determined by polymerase chain reaction. The presence of mutations in long-type dupA was determined by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The prevalence of long-type dupA was 26.3\% (84/319). Sequence analysis showed that there were only six cases (7.1\%) with point mutations lead to stop codon among 84 long-type dupA strains studied. Interestingly, intact long-type dupA without frameshift mutation, but not short-type dupA, was significantly associated with gastric ulcer and gastric cancer than gastritis (p = .001 and p = .019, respectively). After adjustment by age, gender, and cagA, the presence of intact long-type dupA was significantly associated with gastric ulcer and gastric cancer compared with gastritis (odds ratio [OR] = 3.35, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.55-7.24 and OR = 4.14, 95\% CI = 1.23-13.94, respectively).

Hemorrhagic erosions, neutrophil infiltration, lymphoid follicles, and epithelium damage were induced by H. pylori infection. NS-398 and indomethacin aggravated these pathological changes but did not increase viable H. pylori number. H. pylori-increased production of neutrophil chemokine and interferon-gamma was potentiated by NS-398 and indomethacin. Neither NS-398 nor indomethacin caused any pathological changes or cytokine production in normal animals.

  abstract = {WSX-1 is a member of the class I cytokine receptor family with homology to IL-12R beta 2 and is essential for the initial mounting of Th1 responses. STAT1 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated WSX-1, and the conserved tyrosine residue of the cytoplasmic domain of WSX-1 is essential for transcriptional activation of STAT1. IL-27 stimulation induced STAT1 phosphorylation in wild-type but not in WSX-1-deficient naive CD4(+) T cells. Although IL-27 did not directly induce IFN-gamma production by wild-type CD4(+) T cells, IL-12-dependent IFN-gamma production was augmented by IL-27 stimulation in wild-type naive CD4(+) T cells but was impaired in WSX-1-deficient naive CD4(+) T cells. Additionally, IL-27 stimulation induced T-bet and IL-12R beta 2 expression in wild-type, but not in WSX-1-deficient, CD4(+) T cells. Thus, during the initiation of Th1 differentiation, the IL-27/WSX-1 signaling system plays a pivotal role by STAT1-mediated T-bet induction before the IL-12R system.},

  abstract = {Phospholipase C{$\epsilon$} (PLC{$\epsilon$}) is an effector of Ras and Rap small GTPases. We showed previously using PLC{$\epsilon$}-deficient mice that PLC{$\epsilon$} plays a critical role in activation of cytokine production in non-immune skin cells in a variety of inflammatory reactions. For further investigation of its role in inflammation, we created transgenic mice overexpressing PLC{$\epsilon$} in epidermal keratinocytes. The resulting transgenic mice spontaneously developed skin inflammation as characterized by formation of adherent silvery scales, excessive growth of keratinocytes, and aberrant infiltration of immune cells such as T cells and DC. Development of the skin symptoms correlated well with increased expression of factors implicated in human inflammatory skin diseases, such as IL-23, in keratinocytes, and with the accumulation of CD4+ T cells producing IL-22, a potent inducer of keratinocyte proliferation. Intradermal injection of a blocking antibody against IL-23 as well as treatment with the immunosuppressant FK506 reversed these skin phenotypes, which was accompanied by suppression of the IL-22-producing T-cell infiltration. These results reveal a crucial role of PLC{$\epsilon$} in the development of skin inflammation and suggest a mechanism in which PLC{$\epsilon$} induces the production of cytokines including IL-23 from keratinocytes, leading to the activation of IL-22-producing T cells.},

In this study we investigated the ability of the Th2-type cytokines interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, and IL-4 to modulate IL-12 production in Mphi/DC induced through the two pathways. IL-12 production was induced in Mphi/DC from normal mice by stimulation with the combination of IFN-gamma plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (a model for the T cell-independent pathway) or by co-culture with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the CD40L (a model for the T cell-dependent pathway). The effects of three Th2-type cytokines on IL-12 production by Mphi/DC through the two pathways were examined. IL-10 inhibited IL-12 production induced through both pathways, although the inhibitory effect was more potent on the (IFN-gamma + LPS)-induced pathway. IL-6 inhibited only (LPS + IFN-gamma)-induced IL-12 production. The effect of IL-4 was particularly noteworthy: this cytokine inhibited (LPS + IFN-gamma)-induced IL-12 production, whereas it potentiated the production of IL-12 induced by CD40L. Regulation of IL-12 protein production by IL-10 and IL-4 was found to correspond to the levels of mRNA accumulation for the p40 and p35 IL-12 genes, whereas the presence of IL-6 during stimulation decreased IL-12 protein production without affecting steady-state mRNA levels. These results indicate that IL-12 production in Mphi/DC induced through a T cell-dependent or -independent pathway is positively or negatively regulated by particular cytokines at various control levels.},

Chronic gastritis induced by Helicobacter pylori is considered a Th1-mediated process. IL-12 levels in gastric biopsy samples of H. pylori-infected patients are higher than in those of uninfected individuals, but the cellular source of IL-12 remains elusive. IL-12 staining was detected in mucosal epithelial cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages in specimens of patients with H. pylori-positive gastritis. Therefore, we investigated IL-12 p40 mRNA induction by H. pylori in gastric epithelial cells and T cells. Although cag pathogenicity island (PAI)-positive H. pylori induced IL-12 p40 mRNA expression, an isogenic mutant of the cag PAI failed to induce it in both cell types. Supernatants from H. pylori cultures and H. pylori VacA induced IL-12 p40 mRNA expression in T cells but not in epithelial cells. The activation of the IL-12 p40 promoter by H. pylori was mediated through NF-kappaB. The transfection of IkappaB kinase and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase dominant-negative mutants inhibited H. pylori-induced IL-12 p40 activation. Inhibitors of NF-kappaB, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Hsp90 suppressed H. pylori- and VacA-induced IL-12 p40 mRNA expression. The results indicate that H. pylori induces IL-12 p40 expression by the activation of NF-kappaB, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Hsp90 is also a crucial regulator of H. pylori-induced IL-12 p40 expression. In addition to the cag PAI, VacA might be relevant in the induction of IL-12 expression and a Th1-polarized response only in T cells.},

This study characterized the tongue microbiota of tube-fed elderly adults by analyzing the 16S rRNA gene. The terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles of 44 tube-fed subjects were compared with those of 54 subjects fed orally (average age, 86.4 {$\pm$} 6.9 years). Bar-coded pyrosequencing data were also obtained for a subset of the subjects from each group (15 tube-fed subjects and 16 subjects fed orally). The T-RFLP profiles demonstrated that the microbiota of the tube-fed subjects was distinct from that of the subjects fed orally (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [perMANOVA], P {$<$} 0.001). The pyrosequencing data revealed that 22 bacterial genera, including Corynebacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Fusobacterium, were significantly more predominant in tube-fed subjects, whereas the dominant genera in the subjects fed orally, such as Streptococcus and Veillonella, were present in much lower proportions. Opportunistic pathogens rarely detected in the normal oral microbiota, such as Corynebacterium striatum and Streptococcus agalactiae, were often found in high proportions in tube-fed subjects. The oral indigenous microbiota is disrupted by the use of enteral feeding, allowing health-threatening bacteria to thrive.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the pathogenic mechanism of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastric damage, focusing on the relation between cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition and various functional events. NSAIDs, such as indomethacin, at a dose that inhibits prostaglandin (PG) production, enhance gastric motility, resulting in an increase in mucosal permeability, neutrophil infiltration and oxyradical production, and eventually producing gastric lesions. These lesions are prevented by pretreatment with PGE{$_2$} and antisecretory drugs, and also via an atropine-sensitive mechanism, not related to antisecretory action. Although neither rofecoxib (a selective COX-2 inhibitor) nor SC-560 (a selective COX-1 inhibitor) alone damages the stomach, the combined administration of these drugs provokes gastric lesions. SC-560, but not rofecoxib, decreases prostaglandin E{$_2$} (PGE{$_2$}) production and causes gastric hypermotility and an increase in mucosal permeability. COX-2 mRNA is expressed in the stomach after administration of indomethacin and SC-560 but not rofecoxib. The up-regulation of indomethacin-induced COX-2 expression is prevented by atropine at a dose that inhibits gastric hypermotility. In addition, selective COX-2 inhibitors have deleterious influences on the stomach when COX-2 is overexpressed under various conditions, including adrenalectomy, arthritis, and Helicobacter pylori-infection. In summary, gastric hypermotility plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of NSAID-induced gastric damage, and the response, causally related with PG deficiency due to COX-1 inhibition, occurs prior to other pathogenic events such as increased mucosal permeability; and the ulcerogenic properties of NSAIDs require the inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2, the inhibition of COX-1 upregulates COX-2 expression in association with gastric hypermotility, and PGs produced by COX-2 counteract the deleterious effect of COX-1 inhibition.},

CagA-overexpressing DC also exhibited a decline in the responses against LPS stimulation and the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells toward Th1 type cells compared to wild type DC. In addition, the level of phosphorylated IRF3 decreased in CagA-overexpressing DC stimulated with LPS, indicating that activated SHP-2 suppressed the enzymatic activity of TBK1 and consequently IRF3 phosphorylation.

Initially named Campylobacter pyloridis, it was re-named HP when biochemical and genetic characterization of the organism showed that it was not a member of the Campylobacter genus. The finding in 1983 was seminal. It is now recognized that HP is the most common chronic human bacterial infection and it is the most common cause of gastritis. It is strongly implicated in the development of peptic ulcer disease and gastric neoplasms. In the years since its' discovery, much headway has been made in the understanding of this ubiquitous organism that had remained elusive, with much work focused on eradication, in part driven by pharmaceutical research and development. Standard triple therapy emerged to eradicate HP. However, with the emergence of HP resistance, newer regimes have been put forth that include quadruple therapy, sequential therapy and a dizzying array of other combinations bent on eradicating HP. Much less is known about the natural history of HP, the different faces of HP internationally, HP eradication and its effect on gastritis, IM, GU/DU and gastric cancer.

This enables Hp to grow as microcolonies adhered to the host cell surface even in conditions that do not support growth of free-swimming bacteria. We hypothesized that CagA alters host cell physiology to allow Hp to obtain specific nutrients from or across the epithelial barrier. Using a polarized epithelium model system, we find that isogenic {$\Delta$}cagA mutants are defective in cell surface microcolony formation, but exogenous addition of iron to the apical medium partially rescues this defect, suggesting that one of CagA's effects on host cells is to facilitate iron acquisition from the host. Hp adhered to the apical epithelial surface increase basolateral uptake of transferrin and induce its transcytosis in a CagA-dependent manner. Both CagA and VacA contribute to the perturbation of transferrin recycling, since VacA is involved in apical mislocalization of the transferrin receptor to sites of bacterial attachment. To determine if the transferrin recycling pathway is involved in Hp colonization of the cell surface, we silenced transferrin receptor expression during infection. This resulted in a reduced ability of Hp to colonize the polarized epithelium. To test whether CagA is important in promoting iron acquisition in vivo, we compared colonization of Hp in iron-replete vs. iron-deficient Mongolian gerbils. While wild type Hp and {$\Delta$}cagA mutants colonized iron-replete gerbils at similar levels, {$\Delta$}cagA mutants are markedly impaired in colonizing iron-deficient gerbils. Our study indicates that CagA and VacA act in concert to usurp the polarized process of host cell iron uptake, allowing Hp to use the cell surface as a replicative niche.},

  abstract = {Neutrophil infiltration mediated by TNF-alpha is associated with various types of gastric injury, whereas PGs play a crucial role in gastric defense. We examined roles of two isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX) and PGE2 in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis in mice. Mice infected with H. pylori were given selective COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 (10 mg/kg), selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (10 mg/kg), or nonselective COX inhibitor indomethacin (2 mg/kg) with or without 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 for 1 wk. H. pylori infection increased levels of mRNA for COX-1 and -2 in gastric tissue by 1.2-fold and 3.3-fold, respectively, accompanied by a significant increase in PGE2 production by gastric tissue. H. pylori infection significantly elevated MPO activity, a marker of neutrophil infiltration, and epithelial cell apoptosis in the stomach. SC-560 augmented MPO activity and epithelial cell apoptosis with associated reduction in PGE2 production, whereas NS-398 had the same effects without affecting PGE2 production. Inhibition of both COX-1 and -2 by indomethacin or concurrent treatment with SC-560 and NS-398 resulted in a stronger increase in MPO activity and apoptosis than inhibition of either COX-1 or -2 alone. H. pylori infection elevated TNF-alpha mRNA expression in the stomach, which was further increased by indomethacin. Effects of COX inhibitors on neutrophil infiltration, apoptosis, and TNF-alpha expression in H. pylori-infected mice were abolished by exogenous 16,16-dimethyl PGE2. In conclusion, PGE2 derived from either COX-1 or -2 is involved in regulation of gastric mucosal inflammation and contributes to maintenance of mucosal integrity during H. pylori infection via inhibition of TNF-alpha expression.},

  abstract = {The study of interleukin-23 (IL-23) over the past 8 years has led to the realization that cellular immunity is far more complex than previously appreciated, because it is controlled by additional newly identified players. From the analysis of seemingly straightforward cytokine regulation of autoimmune diseases, many limitations of the established paradigms emerged that required reevaluation of the 'rules' that govern the initiation and maintenance of immune responses. This information led to a major revision of the T-helper 1 (Th1)/Th2 hypothesis and discovery of an unexpected link between transforming growth factor-beta-dependent Th17 and inducible regulatory T cells. The aim of this review is to explore the multiple characteristics of IL-23 with respect to its 'id' in autoimmunity, 'ego' in T-cell help, and 'superego' in defense against mucosal pathogens.},

Long-term protective immunity to oral H. pylori challenge was observed 3 months after immunization through the i.m. or oral/i.m. route. Protection correlated with an increase in H. pylori-specific interleukin-12 and both immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG2a serum titers following challenge. Mice that were not protected (oral or i.m./oral) had increased levels of IgA in both sera and Peyer's patches. This study demonstrates the ability to induce long-term immunity against H. pylori, provides correlates of protection, and illustrates the crucial role of the immunization route(s).},

Paradoxically, IM leads to clearing of H. pylori, except for some cases in which it persists in damaging the mucosa. The objective of this study was to compare the profile of mucins and type 1 Lewis antigens in IM cases with and without H. pylori. Gastric biopsies (n=32) were double-stained using immunohistochemistry (MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6, Le(a), sialyl-Le(a), and Le(b)) and histochemistry for H. pylori. H. pylori was observed in association with IM in 4 of 22 biopsies with IM (complete IM - 6; incomplete IM - 16). The four biopsies with IM and H. pylori displayed a particular pattern of incomplete IM: expression of MUC1 and MUC5AC and little/no expression of MUC2. The 18 biopsies with IM and without H. pylori had high levels of MUC2 expression, regardless of the IM type. The pattern of expression of type 1 Lewis antigens was similar in IM, regardless of the presence or absence of H. pylori. It is concluded that H. pylori is able to colonize incomplete IM whenever it contains foci expressing MUCI and MUC5AC and no MUC2, independently from Le(a), sialyl-Le(a) and Le(b). The results suggest, furthermore, that MUC2 expression affects the ability of H. pylori to colonize IM areas, regardless of the levels of expression of MUC1 and MUC5AC.},

Comparison of the binding preferences of the protein to reference glycosphingolipids from other sources suggested that in human granulocytes, the neutrophil-activating protein of H. pylori preferentially recognizes glycoconjugates with a terminally unsubstituted NeuAcalpha3Galbeta4GlcNAcbeta3Galbeta4GlcNAcbeta sequence.},

The ENCODE Consortium, a large group of scientists from around the world, uses a variety of experimental methods to identify and describe the regions of the 3 billion base-pair human genome that are important for function. Using experimental, computational, and statistical analyses, we aimed to discover and describe genes, transcripts, and transcriptional regulatory regions, as well as DNA binding proteins that interact with regulatory regions in the genome, including transcription factors, different versions of histones and other markers, and DNA methylation patterns that define states of the genome in various cell types. The ENCODE Project has developed standards for each experiment type to ensure high-quality, reproducible data and novel algorithms to facilitate analysis. All data and derived results are made available through a freely accessible database. This article provides an overview of the complete project and the resources it is generating, as well as examples to illustrate the application of ENCODE data as a user's guide to facilitate the interpretation of the human genome.},

To begin to examine the biological role of O-linked glycosylation, mammalian cells were treated with a small molecule inhibitor (designated 1-68A, Ref. 15) of ppGaNTase activity. NIH3T3 cells exposed to the inhibitor were shown to undergo a significant reduction in cell surface O-glycosylation as detected by staining with jacalin and peanut agglutinin lectins after 30 min of treatment; no reduction in staining using antibodies to O-linked N-acetylglucosamine or the lectin concanavalin A was detected. Apoptosis was also observed in treated cells after 45 min of exposure, ostensibly following the O-glycosylation reduction. Overexpression of several different ppGaNTase isoforms restored cell surface O-glycosylation and rescued inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Additionally, mouse embryonic mandibular organ cultures exposed to 1-68A developed abnormally, presumably because of epithelial and mesenchymal apoptosis that followed a reduction in jacalin and peanut agglutinin staining. Our studies suggest that mucin-type O-linked glycosylation may be required for normal development and that ppGaNTases may play a role in the regulation of apoptosis.},

This study aimed to construct and characterize a non-virulent Vibrio cholerae O1 strain, which grows more rapidly than H.~pylori, as vector for H.~pylori antigens for possible use as a vaccine strain against H.~pylori. This was done by recombinant expression of the H.~pylori adhesion antigen HpaA alone or, as a proof of principle, together with different colonization factor (CF) antigens of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) which may enhance immune responses against HpaA. A recombinant V.~cholerae strain co-expressing HpaA and a fimbrial CF antigens CFA/I or CS5, but not the non-fimbrial CF protein CS6, was shown to express larger amounts of HpaA on the surface when compared with the same V.~cholerae strain expressing HpaA alone. Mutations in the CFA/I operon showed that the chaperon, possibly together with the usher, was involved in enhancing the surface expression of HpaA. Oral immunization of mice with formaldehyde-inactivated recombinant V.~cholerae expressing HpaA alone or together with CFA/I induced significantly higher serum antibody responses against HpaA than mice similarly immunized with inactivated HpaA-expressing H.~pylori bacteria. Our results demonstrate that a non-virulent V.~cholerae strain can be engineered to allow strong surface expression of HpaA, and that the expression can be further increased by co-expressing it with ETEC fimbrial antigens. Such recombinant V.~cholerae strains expressing HpaA, and possibly also other H.~pylori antigens, may have the potential as oral inactivated vaccine candidates against H.~pylori.},

Sequence analysis indicates that H. pylori has well-developed systems for motility, for scavenging iron, and for DNA restriction and modification. Many putative adhesins, lipoproteins and other outer membrane proteins were identified, underscoring the potential complexity of host-pathogen interaction. Based on the large number of sequence-related genes encoding outer membrane proteins and the presence of homopolymeric tracts and dinucleotide repeats in coding sequences, H. pylori, like several other mucosal pathogens, probably uses recombination and slipped-strand mispairing within repeats as mechanisms for antigenic variation and adaptive evolution. Consistent with its restricted niche, H. pylori has a few regulatory networks, and a limited metabolic repertoire and biosynthetic capacity. Its survival in acid conditions depends, in part, on its ability to establish a positive inside-membrane potential in low pH.},

Although TH1- and TH-17-differentiated cells expressed the repertoire of cell surface glycans critical for galectin-1-induced cell death, TH2 cells were protected from galectin-1 through differential sialylation of cell surface glycoproteins. Consistent with those findings, galectin-1-deficient mice developed greater TH1 and TH-17 responses and enhanced susceptibility to autoimmune neuroinflammation. Our findings identify a molecular link among differential glycosylation of T helper cells, susceptibility to cell death and termination of the inflammatory response.},

  abstract = {Background: The presence of enterohepatic Helicobacter species (EHS) is commonly noted in mouse colonies. These infections often remain unrecognized but can cause severe health complications or more subtle host immune perturbations and therefore can confound the results of animal experiments. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize a putative novel EHS that has previously been detected by PCR screening of specific-pathogen-free mice.Materials and Methods: Biochemical analysis of enzyme activities (API campy), morphologic investigation (Gram-staining and electron microscopy) and genetic analyses (16SrRNA and 23SrRNA analyses, DNA fingerprinting, restriction fragment polymorphisms, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) were used to characterize isolated EHS. Genomic DNA fragments were sequenced to develop a species-specific PCR detection assay.Results: Scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of spiral-shaped EHS, which varied in length (2.5\textendash 6 {$\mu$}m) and contained single monopolar or single bipolar sheathed flagella. The bacteria were grown under anaerobic conditions, preferably on agar plates containing serum or blood. The 16SrRNA, genetic, and biochemical analyses indicated the identification of a novel EHS species, named Helicobacter magdeburgensis. We also examined the genome content using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Based on the pattern produced by two restriction enzymes, BamIII and KspI, the genome size was determined to be about 1.7\textendash 1.8 Mbp.Conclusion: We isolated and characterized a novel EHS species, H. magdeburgensis, morphologically, biochemically, and genetically. These results are important for future studies on the prevalence and pathophysiologic relevance of such infections. Our PCR assay can be used to detect and discriminate H. magdeburgensis from other Helicobacter species.},

Dendritic cells (DCs) and phagocytes produce IL-12 in response to pathogens during infection. Production of IL-12 is dependent on differential mechanisms of regulation of expression of the genes encoding IL-12, patterns of Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression and cross-regulation between the different DC subsets, involving cytokines such as IL-10 and type I IFN. Recent data, however, argue against an absolute requirement for IL-12 for TH1 responses. Our understanding of the relative roles of IL-12 and other factors in TH1-type maturation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is discussed here, including the participation in this process of IL-23 and IL-27, two recently discovered members of the new family of heterodimeric cytokines.},

AIM: To validate whether the corpus-predominant gastritis index (CGI) can serve as an early marker to identify the H. pylori-infected patients at risk of gastric carcinogenesis. METHODS: This study enrolled 188 subjects, including 43 noncardiac gastric cancer patients, 63 of their first-degree relatives and 82 sex- and age-matched duodenal ulcer patients as controls. All received endoscopy to provide topographic gastric specimens to test for H. pylori infection and its related histological features, translated into the operative link on gastritis assessment (OLGA), operative link on gastric intestinal metaplasia assessment (OLGIM) stages, and the presence of CGI. Spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) was assessed by immunohistochemistry staining of trefoil factor 2. RESULTS: Gastric cancer patients had higher prevalence of CGI and OLGIM stage II-IV, but not OLGA stage II-IV, than the controls (P = 0.001, OR = 3.4[95\% CI: 1.4-8.1] for CGI; OR = 5.0[95\% CI: 2.0-12.8] for OLGIM). In patients with the combined presence of CGI and OLGIM stage II-IV, the risk of gastric cancer increased to 9.8 (P {$<$} 0.001). The first-degree relatives of the gastric cancer patients had a higher rate of the presence of CGI, but not OLGA or OLGIM stage II-IV than the duodenal ulcer controls (P = 0.001). Of the first-degree relatives, the presence of CGI increased the risk of SPEM (P = 0.003, OR = 5.5[95\% CI: 1.8-17.0]). CONCLUSION: The corpus-predominant gastritis index, which is highly correlated to SPEM, may serve as an early marker to identify the H. pylori-infected patients at a higher risk of gastric cancer.},

Treatment with curcumin in the diet or by intraperitoneal injection significantly inhibited tumorigenicity and tumor growth, decreased the percentages of MDSCs in the spleen, blood, and tumor tissues, reduced interleukin (IL)-6 levels in the serum and tumor tissues in a human gastric cancer xenograft model and a mouse colon cancer allograft model. Curcumin treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation of cancer cells and decreased the secretion of murine IL-6 by MDSCs in a coculture system. Curcumin treatment inhibited the expansion of MDSCs, the activation of Stat3 and NF-{$\kappa$}B in MDSCs, and the secretion of IL-6 by MDSCs, when MDSCs were cultured in the presence of IL-1{$\beta$}, or with cancer cell- or myofibroblast-conditioned medium. Furthermore, curcumin treatment polarized MDSCs toward a M1-like phenotype with an increased expression of CCR7 and decreased expression of dectin 1 in vivo and in vitro. Our results show that curcumin inhibits the accumulation of MDSCs and their interaction with cancer cells and induces the differentiation of MDSCs. The induction of MDSC differentiation and inhibition of the interaction of MDSCs with cancer cells are potential strategies for cancer prevention and therapy.},

We created a bank of 40,000 random chromosomal fragments of H. pylori 84-183 by using lambda ZapII. Screening of this bank in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue with absorbed serum from an H. pylori-infected person permitted the isolation and purification of a clone with a 3.5-kb insert. Subcloning of this insert (pMC3) permitted the expression of a recombinant H. pylori protein that had a mass of approximately 96 kDa and that was recognized by the human serum. Sera that were obtained from H. pylori-infected persons and that recognized the native 120- to 128-kDa H. pylori antigen recognized the recombinant 96-kDa pMC3 protein to a significantly greater extent than did sera that did not recognize the native H. pylori antigen. All 19 H. pylori isolates producing the 120- to 128-kDa antigen hybridized with pMC3; none of 13 nonproducers did so (P {$<$} 0.001). Because all 15 isolates producing the vacuolating cytotoxin hybridized with pMC3, we called the gene cagA (cytotoxin-associated gene). Sequence analysis of pMC3 identified an open reading frame of 859 amino acids, without a termination codon. Parallel screening of a lambda gt11 library with human serum revealed positive plaques with identical 0.6-kb inserts and sequences matching the sequence of the downstream region of pMC3. To clone the full-length gene, we used the 0.6-kb fragment as a probe and isolated a clone with a 2.7-kb insert from the lambda ZapII genomic library. Nucleotide sequencing of this insert (pYB 2) revealed a 785-bp sequence that overlapped the downstream region of pMC3. Translation of the complete nucleotide sequence of cagA revealed an open reading frame of 1,181 amino acids yielding a protein of 131,517 daltons. There was no significant homology with any previously reported protein sequence. These findings indicate the cloning and characterization of a high-molecular-mass H. pylori antigen potentially associated with virulence and with cytotoxin production.},

The frequency with which these processes are disrupted in disease can be taken as evidence of their importance. It is therefore of interest to define the mechanisms of altered intestinal barrier and transport function and develop means to correct disease-associated defects. Over the past 10 years, some of the molecular events underlying physiological epithelial barrier regulation have been described. Remarkably, recent advances have shown that activation of the same mechanisms is central to barrier dysfunction in both in vitro and in vivo models of disease. Although the contribution of barrier dysfunction to pathogenesis of chronic disease remains incompletely understood, it is now clear that cytoskeletal regulation of barrier function is both an important pathogenic process and that targeted inhibition of myosin light chain kinase, which affects this cytoskeleton-dependent tight junction dysfunction, is an attractive candidate for therapeutic intervention.},

Unlike spleen DCs, the LPDCs specifically produced retinoic acid, which, in a dose-dependent way, supported the generation and retention of immunoglobulin A-producing cells in the lamina propria and positively regulated the differentiation interleukin 17-producing T helper cells.

Certain H. pylori strains nonopsonized stimulate neutrophils to production of reactive oxygen species causing oxidative damage of the gastric epithelium. Here, the contribution of some H. pylori virulence factors, the blood group antigen-binding adhesin BabA, the sialic acid-binding adhesin SabA, the neutrophil-activating protein HP-NAP, and the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA, to the activation of human neutrophils in terms of adherence, phagocytosis, and oxidative burst was investigated. Neutrophils were challenged with wild type bacteria and isogenic mutants lacking BabA, SabA, HP-NAP, or VacA. Mutant and wild type strains lacking SabA had no neutrophil-activating capacity, demonstrating that binding of H. pylori to sialylated neutrophil receptors plays a pivotal initial role in the adherence and phagocytosis of the bacteria and the induction of the oxidative burst. The link between receptor binding and oxidative burst involves a G-protein-linked signaling pathway and downstream activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase as shown by experiments using signal transduction inhibitors. Collectively our data suggest that the sialic acid-binding SabA adhesin is a prerequisite for the nonopsonic activation of human neutrophils and, thus, is a virulence factor important for the pathogenesis of H. pylori infection.},

In this article, we describe Primer3's current capabilities, emphasizing recent improvements. The most notable enhancements incorporate more accurate thermodynamic models in the primer design process, both to improve melting temperature prediction and to reduce the likelihood that primers will form hairpins or dimers. Additional enhancements include more precise control of primer placement\textemdash a change motivated partly by opportunities to use whole-genome sequences to improve primer specificity. We also added features to increase ease of use, including the ability to save and re-use parameter settings and the ability to require that individual primers not be used in more than one primer pair. We have made the core code more modular and provided cleaner programming interfaces to further ease integration with other software.

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a major human pathogen which causes progressive gastroduodenal damage. Guidelines recommend that, unless there are compelling reasons to delay, treatment is indicated for all patients in whom the infection is diagnosed. The rapid urease test (RUT) is a popular diagnostic test in that it is a rapid, cheap and simple test that detects the presence of urease in or on the gastric mucosa. The sensitivity and specificity are generally high and many versions have been approved for use in humans. Best results are obtained if biopsies are obtained from both the antrum and corpus. The tissue sample embedded in the RUT gel can also be utilized for other tests such as for molecular based tests of microbial susceptibility or for host factors. False-positive results are rare if the RUT contains an antibacterial agent to prevent growth of urease-containing contaminants and the tests are discarded at 24 hours. The use of antimicrobial drugs and proton pump inhibitors as well as the presence of intestinal metaplasia may result in false-negative results. A negative test should not be used as the criteria for cure or in cases where accuracy is important for patient management such as in upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Interpretation of the test should take into account the pretest probability and the prevalence of H. pylori in the population. The test can also be used to provide an informal assessment of the accuracy of the histopathology result and discrepancies should prompt a review of the histopathology and discussions with the pathologist.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is an infectious agent that colonizes the gastric mucosa of half of the population worldwide. This bacterium has been recognized as belonging to group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organization for the role in development of gastritis, peptic ulcers, and cancer. Due to the increase in resistance to antibiotics used in the anti-H. pylori therapy, the development of an effective vaccine is an alternative of great interest, which remains a challenge. Therefore, a rational, strategic, and efficient vaccine design against H. pylori is necessary where the use of the most current bioinformatics tools could help achieve it. In this study, immunoinformatics approach was used to design a novel multiepitope oral vaccine against H. pylori. Our multiepitope vaccine is composed of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) that is used as a mucosal adjuvant to enhance vaccine immunogenicity for oral immunization. CTB fused to 11 epitopes predicted of pathogenic (UreB170-189, VacA459-478, CagA1103-1122, GGT106-126, NapA30-44, and OipA211-230) and colonization (HpaA33-52, FlaA487-506, FecA437-456, BabA129-149, and SabA540-559) proteins from H. pylori. CKS9 peptide (CKSTHPLSC) targets epithelial microfold cells to enhance vaccine uptake from the gut barrier. All sequences were joined to each other by proper linkers. The vaccine was modeled and validated to achieve a high-quality three-dimensional structure. The vaccine design was evaluated as nonallergenic, antigenic, soluble, and with an appropriate molecular weight and isoelectric point. Our results suggest that our newly designed vaccine could serve as a promising anti-H. pylori vaccine candidate.},

We defined the distinct signaling mechanisms that regulate the LPS-mediated induction of IL-23 p19 and p40 in human macrophages and dendritic cells. We found that the overexpression of dominant-negative Rac1 (N17Rac1) enhanced LPS-induced IL-23 p19 expression but did not alter p40 expression or IL-12 p70 production in PMA-treated THP-1 macrophages and in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Although the inhibition of either p38 MAPK or JNK enhanced LPS-induced p19 expression, N17Rac1 did not influence either p38 MAPK or JNK activation. By contrast, N17Rac1 augmented both NF-{$\kappa$}B gene expression and p65 trans activation stimulated by LPS without affecting the degradation of I{$\kappa$}B-{$\alpha$} or DNA binding to NF-{$\kappa$}B. Furthermore, small interference RNA of NF-{$\kappa$}B p65 attenuated cellular amounts of p65 and suppressed LPS-induced p19 expression but did not affect p40 expression. Our findings indicate that Rac1 negatively controls LPS-induced IL-23 p19 expression through an NF-{$\kappa$}B p65 trans activation-dependent, I{$\kappa$}B-independent pathway and that NF-{$\kappa$}B p65 regulates LPS-induced IL-23 p19, but not p40, expression, which causes differences in the control of IL-23 p19 and p40 expression by Rac1.},

  abstract = {ROR{$\gamma$}t(+) T(H)17 cells are a proinflammatory CD4(+) T-cell population associated with autoimmune tissue injury. In mice, priming of T(H)17 requires TGF-{$\beta$}, which alone directs the priming of FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg), in association with inflammatory cytokines. Priming of human T(H)17 cells from conventional naive CD4(+) T cells under similar conditions, however, has proved difficult to achieve. Here, we report that differentiation of human T(H)17 cells preferentially occurs from FOXP3(+) naive Treg (NTreg) in the presence of IL-2 and IL-1{$\beta$} and is increased by IL-23 and TGF-{$\beta$}. IL-1{$\beta$}-mediated differentiation correlated with IL-1RI expression in stimulated NTreg and was accompanied by induction of ROR{$\gamma$}t along with down-regulation of FOXP3. IL-17-secreting cells in NTreg cultures cosecreted TNF-{$\alpha$} and IL-2 and contained distinct subpopulations cosecreting or not cosecreting IFN-{$\gamma$} and other T(H)17-associated cytokines. Polarized NTreg contained significant subpopulations of CCR6-expressing cells that were highly enriched in IL-17-secreting cells. Finally, analysis of CCR6 expression with respect to that of IL-1RI identified distinct IL-17-secreting subpopulations that had maintained or lost their suppressive functions. Together our results support the concept that priming of human T(H)17 from naive CD4(+) T cells preferentially takes place from FOXP3(+) Treg precursors in the presence of lineage-specific polarizing factors.},

The aim of this study was to assess the relationships between H. pylori cagA, vacA, and iceA status and severity of disease. METHODS: Gastric biopsy specimens from 94 patients in The Netherlands were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and reverse hybridization. RESULTS: cagA was present in 63 (67\%) of 94 cases and was associated with peptic ulcer disease (P = 0.0019). vacA geno-types s1a/m1, s1b/m2, s1b/m1, s1b/m2, and s2/m2 were found in 36.2\%, 23.4\%, 2.1\%, 5.3\%, and 20.2\%, respectively. Ten isolates (10.6\%) contained multiple vacA genotypes. The presence of peptic ulcers was associated with type s1 strains (P = 0.0006) but not with the m type (P = 0.2035). cagA and vacA s1 were strongly associated (P {$<$} 10(-5)). iceA1 was found in 53 (56.4\%) and iceA2 in 25 (26.6\%) of the 94 cases. In 14 isolates (14.9\%), both iceA alleles were found, and 2 (2.1\%) were negative for both iceA1 and iceA2. iceA1 was also associated with peptic ulcer disease (P = 0.0042). The iceA allelic type was independent of the cagA and vacA status. CONCLUSIONS: vacA s1, cagA, and iceA1 are markers of H. pylori strains that are more likely to lead to ulcer disease.},

Most studies demonstrate a significant correlation between H. pylori density and the grade of acute and chronic inflammation, taking into account the limitations of each method for density assessment. Overall, high bacterial loads are associated with increased acute mucosal damage and long-term changes in the gastric mucosa. The influence of H. pylori density reduction on the improvement of gastric mucosal changes was observed in studies using 'clearance' therapies. Mucosal agents provoke a significant, but not persistent, reduction in gastritis activity. Treatments suppressing the density and virulence of H. pylori could become strategies to prevent H. pylori-associated disease in the future.},

  abstract = {In anatomic pathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) serves as a diagnostic and prognostic method for identification of disease markers in tissue samples that directly influences classification and grading the disease, influencing patient management. However, till today over most of the world, pathological analysis of tissue samples remained a time-consuming and subjective procedure, wherein the intensity of antibody staining is manually judged and thus scoring decision is directly influenced by visual bias. This instigated us to design a simple method of automated digital IHC image analysis algorithm for an unbiased, quantitative assessment of antibody staining intensity in tissue sections. As a first step, we adopted the spectral deconvolution method of DAB/hematoxylin color spectra by using optimized optical density vectors of the color deconvolution plugin for proper separation of the DAB color spectra. Then the DAB stained image is displayed in a new window wherein it undergoes pixel-by-pixel analysis, and displays the full profile along with its scoring decision. Based on the mathematical formula conceptualized, the algorithm is thoroughly tested by analyzing scores assigned to thousands (n = 1703) of DAB stained IHC images including sample images taken from human protein atlas web resource. The IHC Profiler plugin developed is compatible with the open resource digital image analysis software, ImageJ, which creates a pixel-by-pixel analysis profile of a digital IHC image and further assigns a score in a four tier system. A comparison study between manual pathological analysis and IHC Profiler resolved in a match of 88.6\% (P{$<$}0.0001, CI = 95\%). This new tool developed for clinical histopathological sample analysis can be adopted globally for scoring most protein targets where the marker protein expression is of cytoplasmic and/or nuclear type. We foresee that this method will minimize the problem of inter-observer variations across labs and further help in worldwide patient stratification potentially benefitting various multinational clinical trial initiatives.},

The recent development by Graham et al. of the model of H. pylori challenge in humans, the recent published clinical trials and the last insight generated in animal models of H. pylori infection regarding the immune mechanisms leading to vaccine-induced Helicobacter clearance will facilitate the evaluation of immunogenicity and efficacy of H. pylori vaccine candidates in Phase II and III clinical trials.},

This study explores the possibility that interleukin (IL)-17 plays a role in the reduction of Helicobacter infection following vaccination of wild-type animals or in spontaneous reduction of bacterial infection in IL-10-deficient mice. METHODS: In mice, reducing Helicobacter infection, the levels and source of IL-17 were determined and the role of IL-17 in reduction of Helicobacter infection was probed by neutralizing antibodies. RESULTS: Gastric IL-17 levels were strongly increased in mice mucosally immunized with urease plus cholera toxin and challenged with Helicobacter felis as compared with controls (654 +/- 455 and 34 +/- 84 relative units for IL-17 messenger RNA expression [P {$<$} .01] and 6.9 +/- 8.4 and 0.02 +/- 0.04 pg for IL-17 protein concentration [P {$<$} .01], respectively). Flow cytometry analysis showed that a peak of CD4(+)IL-17(+) T cells infiltrating the gastric mucosa occurred in immunized mice in contrast to control mice (4.7\% +/- 0.3\% and 1.4\% +/- 0.3\% [P {$<$} .01], respectively). Gastric mucosa-infiltrating CD4(+)IL-17(+) T cells were also observed in IL-10-deficient mice that spontaneously reduced H felis infection (4.3\% +/- 2.3\% and 2\% +/- 0.6\% [P {$<$} .01], for infected and noninfected IL-10-deficient mice, respectively). In wild-type immunized mice, intraperitoneal injection of anti-IL-17 antibodies significantly inhibited inflammation and the reduction of Helicobacter infection in comparison with control antibodies (1 of 12 mice vs 9 of 12 mice reduced Helicobacter infection [P {$<$} .01], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: IL-17 plays a critical role in the immunization-induced reduction of Helicobacter infection from the gastric mucosa.},

Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) signaling is believed to regulate immune and inflammatory responses. We investigated the role of PAR2 in vaccine-induced immunity against Helicobacter infection. METHODS: Immune responses against Helicobacter infection were compared between vaccinated PAR2-/- and wild-type (WT) mice. Bacterial persistence, gastric pathology, and inflammatory and cellular responses were assessed using the rapid urease test (RUT), histologic analyses, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: Following vaccination, PAR2-/- mice did not have reductions in Helicobacter felis infection (RUT values were 0.01{$\pm$}0.01 for WT mice and 0.11{$\pm$}0.13 for PAR2-/- mice; P{$<$}.05). The vaccinated PAR2-/- mice had reduced inflammation-induced stomach tissue damage (tissue damage scores were 8.83{$\pm$}1.47 for WT mice and 4.86{$\pm$}1.35 for PAR2-/- mice; P{$<$}.002) and reduced T-helper (Th)17 responses, based on reduced urease-induced interleukin (IL)-17 secretion by stomach mononuclear cells (5182 {$\pm$} 1265 pg/mL for WT mice and 350{$\pm$}436 pg/mL for PAR2-/- mice; P{$<$}.03) and reduced recruitment of CD4+ IL-17+ T cells into the gastric mucosa of PAR2-/- mice following bacterial challenge (3.7\%{$\pm$}1.5\% for WT mice and 2.6\%{$\pm$}1.1\% for PAR2-/- mice; P{$<$}.05). In vitro, H felis-stimulated dendritic cells (DCs) from WT mice induced greater secretion of IL-17 by ovalbumin-stimulated OT-II transgenic CD4+ T cells compared with DCs from PAR2-/- mice (4298{$\pm$}347 and 3230{$\pm$}779; P{$<$}.04), indicating that PAR2-/- DCs are impaired in priming of Th17 cells. Adoptive transfer of PAR2+/+ DCs into vaccinated PAR2-/- mice increased vaccine-induced protection (RUT values were 0.11{$\pm$}0.10 and 0.26{$\pm$}0.15 for injected and noninjected mice, respectively; P{$<$}.03).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both N-nitroso compounds and colonization with Helicobacter pylori represent known risk-factors for the development of gastric cancer. Endogenous formation of N-nitroso compounds is thought to occur predominantly in acidic environments such as the stomach. At neutral pH, bacteria can catalyze the formation of N-nitroso compounds. Based on experiments with a noncarcinogenic N-nitroso compound as end product, and using only a single H. pylori strain, it was recently reported that H. pylori only displays a low nitrosation capacity. As H. pylori is a highly diverse bacterial species, it is reasonable to question the generality of this finding. In this study, several genetically distinct H. pylori strains are tested for their capacity to form carcinogenic N-nitrosamines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacteria were grown in the presence of 0-1000 microM morpholine and nitrite (in a 1 : 1 molar ratio), at pH 7, 5 and 3. RESULTS: Incubation of Neisseria cinerea (positive control) with 500 microM morpholine and 500 microM nitrite, resulted in a significant increase in formation of N-nitrosomorpholine, but there was no significant induction of N-nitrosomorpholine formation by any of the H. pylori strains, at any of the three pH conditions. CONCLUSION: H. pylori does not induce formation of the carcinogenic N-nitrosomorpholine in vitro. The previously reported weak nitrosation capacity of H. pylori is not sufficient to nitrosate the more difficulty nitrosatable morpholine. This probably also holds true for other secondary amines. These results imply that the increased incidence of gastric cancer formation that is associated with gastric colonization by H. pylori is unlikely to result from the direct induced formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines by H. pylori. However, this has to be further confirmed in in vivo studies.},

Previous studies in mice showed that an H. suis infection does not result in protective immunity, whereas immunization with H. suis whole-cell lysate (lysate) protects against a subsequent experimental infection. Therefore, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of H. suis proteins was performed followed by immunoblotting with pooled sera from H. suis- infected mice or mice immunized with lysate. Weak reactivity against H. suis proteins was observed in post-infection sera. Sera from lysate-immunized mice, however, showed immunoreactivity against a total of 19 protein spots which were identified using LC-MS/MS. The H. suis urease subunit B (UreB) showed most pronounced reactivity against sera from lysate-immunized mice and was not detected with sera from infected mice. None of the pooled sera detected H. suis neutrophil-activating protein A (NapA). The protective efficacy of intranasal vaccination of BALB/c mice with H. suis UreB and NapA, both recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli (rUreB and rNapA, respectively), was compared with that of H. suis lysate. All vaccines contained choleratoxin as adjuvant. Immunization of mice with rUreB and lysate induced a significant reduction of H. suis colonization compared to non-vaccinated H. suis-infected controls, whereas rNapA had no significant protective effect. Probably, a combination of local Th1 and Th17 responses, complemented by antibody responses play a role in the protective immunity against H. suis infections.},

We report here that the noninvasive Gram-negative pathogen Helicobacter pylori was recognized by epithelial cells via Nod1, an intracellular pathogen-recognition molecule with specificity for Gram-negative peptidoglycan. Nod1 detection of H. pylori depended on the delivery of peptidoglycan to host cells by a bacterial type IV secretion system, encoded by the H. pylori cag pathogenicity island. Consistent with involvement of Nod1 in host defense, Nod1-deficient mice were more susceptible to infection by cag pathogenicity island-positive H. pylori than were wild-type mice. We propose that sensing of H. pylori by Nod1 represents a model for host recognition of noninvasive pathogens.},

Consistent with this model for cytokine-dependent regulation, they also demonstrate that the inhibitory effect can be mediated by several signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family transcription factors, namely STAT5, STAT4, and STAT6.

The current work demonstrates that during infection with Toxoplasma gondii, IL-27R-deficient mice generate aberrant IL-2 responses that are associated with the development of a lethal inflammatory disease. Because in vivo depletion of IL-2 prolongs the survival of infected IL-27R-/- mice, these data suggest that IL-27 curbs the development of immunopathology by limiting parasite-induced IL-2 production. Consistent with this hypothesis, IL-27R-/- CD4+ T cells produce more IL-2 than wild-type counterparts during in vitro differentiation, and when rIL-27 is introduced, it can suppress the expression of IL-2 mRNA and protein by the latter group. Additionally, these studies reveal that, like IL-27, IL-12 can inhibit IL-2 production, and although each employs distinct mechanisms, they can synergize to enhance the effect. In contrast, this property is not shared by closely related cytokines IL-6 and IL-23. Thus, while traditionally viewed as proinflammatory agents, the present findings establish that IL-27 and IL-12 cooperate to limit the availability of IL-2, a potent T cell growth and survival factor. Moreover, because the current studies demonstrate that both can induce expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, a protein that tempers cytokine receptor signaling, they also suggest that IL-27 and IL-12 share additionally inhibitory properties.},

  abstract = {Previous reports have focused on the ability of IL-27 to promote naive T cell responses but the present study reveals that surface expression of WSX-1, the ligand-specific component of the IL-27R, is low on these cells and that highest levels are found on effector and memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Accordingly, during infection with Toxoplasma gondii, in vivo T cell activation is associated with enhanced expression of WSX-1, and, in vitro, TCR ligation can induce expression of WSX-1 regardless of the polarizing (Th1/Th2) environment present at the time of priming. However, while these data establish that mitogenic stimulation promotes expression of WSX-1 by T cells, activation of NK cells and NKT cells prompts a reduction in WSX-1 levels during acute toxoplasmosis. Together, with the finding that IL-2 can suppress expression of WSX-1 by activated CD4(+) T cells, these studies indicate that surface levels of the IL-27R can be regulated by positive and negative signals associated with lymphoid cell activation. Additionally, since high levels of WSX-1 are evident on resting NK cells, resting NKT cells, effector T cells, regulatory T cells, and memory T cells, the current work demonstrates that IL-27 can influence multiple effector cells of innate and adaptive immunity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Infection with Helicobacter pylori causes chronic gastritis, and this confers a risk of gastric cancer. Short alleles of the membrane-bound mucin MUC1, which has a large extracellular highly glycosylated domain and is highly polymorphic due to variation in the number of tandemly repeated (TR) 20-amino acid units, have been shown to be associated with gastric cancer. Our aim was to investigate the involvement of MUC1 in chronic gastritis and, by implication, gastric cancer. METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on endoscopic biopsy specimens from 95 patients. Gastritis was classified using the Sydney System, and H. pylori status was determined. MUC1 was detected with antibodies against different epitopes of the TR region and the cytoplasmic tail. Southern blot analysis of the MUC1 gene was performed on 57 Northern European patients to determine TR allele lengths. RESULTS: With the TR antibodies, apical staining and some perinuclear staining was seen in 34 of 41 biopsy specimens classified as histologically normal and H. pylori negative. None of the 36 biopsy specimens with gastritis and current H. pylori infection showed apical staining. In contrast, the cytoplasmic tail antibody detected apical staining in both groups. Comparison of the MUC1 allele length distributions between Northern European patients with H. pylori infection and those without H. pylori gastritis showed a statistically significant difference in distribution, with shorter alleles associated with H. pylori gastritis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that H. pylori interacts with MUC1 and that there are functional allelic differences that affect susceptibility to gastritis.},

The maintenance, expansion, and further differentiation of the committed Th17 cells depend on IL-1beta and IL-23. IL-17 was originally found produced by circulating human CD45RO(+) memory T cells. A recent study found that human Th17 memory cells selectively express high levels of CCR6. In this study, we report that human peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue contain a significant number of CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T cells that express CCR6 and have the capacity to produce IL-17 upon activation. These cells coexpress FOXP3 and RORgammat transcription factors. The CD4(+)FOXP3(+)CCR6(+) IL-17-producing cells strongly inhibit the proliferation of CD4(+) responder T cells. CD4(+)CD25(high)-derived T-cell clones express FOXP3, RORgammat, and IL-17 and maintain their suppressive function via a cell-cell contact mechanism. We further show that human CD4(+)FOXP3(+)CCR6(-) regulatory T (Treg) cells differentiate into IL-17 producer cells upon T-cell receptor stimulation in the presence of IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-21, IL-23, and human serum. This, together with the finding that human thymus does not contain IL-17-producing Treg cells, suggests that the IL-17(+)FOXP3(+) Treg cells are generated in the periphery. IL-17-producing Treg cells may play critical roles in antimicrobial defense, while controlling autoimmunity and inflammation.},

Based on published data concerning the high specificity and sensitivity of immunohistochemical detection of H. pylori, we examined the prevalence of H. pylori in gastric biopsy specimens of Estonian children by different localization and morphological type of gastritis comparing Giemsa staining with immunohistochemistry. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Formalin-fixed biopsies (107 antral, 108 corpus mucosa) of 112 children (41 boys, 71 girls, age range 1-16 years, median age 12 years) with abdominal complaints were stained with hematoxylin \& eosin and Giemsa stains, as well as examined using the peroxidase antiperoxidase (PAP) method with polyclonal antibodies to H. pylori. RESULTS: Gastritis of any degree and localization was found in 84/112 (75\%) children. Using Giemsa staining H. pylori were detected in 83/112 (74\%) of all children, and by use of the PAP method in 55/112 (49\%) (p = .001). Concordance of the results of immunohistochemical and Giemsa methods in antrum biopsies was 70\%, in corpus biopsies 73\%. In 12 out of 108 (11\%) corpus mucosa specimens a positive staining with anti-H. pylori IgG was localized in the cytoplasma of corpus mucosal cells in the neck part of the glands. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of H. pylori was higher when employing the Giemsa stain in comparison with immunohistochemistry. Antibody reactivity of cells in the neck part of the corpus glands may either be due to cross-reactivity of anti-H. pylori IgG with epithelial cell epitopes, or to internalization of H. pylori by these cells, suggesting a pathogenic role of neck cells in an anti-H. pylori immune response.},

Some Gram-negative pathogens use a versatile Type IV secretion system (T4SS) that can translocate DNA or proteins into host cells. T4SSs represent major bacterial virulence determinants and have recently been the focus of intense research efforts designed to better understand and combat infectious diseases. Interestingly, although the two major classes of T4SSs function in a similar manner to secrete proteins, the translocated 'effectors' vary substantially from one organism to another. In fact, differing effector repertoires likely contribute to organism-specific host cell interactions and disease outcomes. In this review, we discuss the current state of T4SS research, with an emphasis on intracellular bacterial pathogens of humans and the diverse array of translocated effectors used to manipulate host cells.},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is a highly-adapted gastrointestinal pathogen of humans and the immunology of this chronic infection is extremely complex. Despite the availability of antibiotic therapy, the global incidence of H. pylori infection remains high, particularly in low to middle-income nations. Failure of therapy and the spread of antibiotic resistance among the bacteria are significant problems and provide impetus for the development of new therapies and vaccines to treat or prevent gastric ulcer, and gastric carcinoma. The expansion of knowledge on gastric conventional and regulatory T cell responses, and the role of TH17 in chronic gastritis from studies in mouse models and patients have provided valuable insights into how gastritis is initiated and maintained. The development of human challenge models for testing candidate vaccines has meant a unique opportunity to study acute infection, but the field of vaccine development has not progressed as rapidly as anticipated. One clear lesson learned from previous studies is that we need a better understanding of the immune suppressive mechanisms in vivo to be able to design vaccine strategies. There is still an urgent need to identify practical surrogate markers of protection that could be deployed in future field vaccine trials. Important developments in our understanding of the chronic inflammatory response, progress and problems arising from human studies, and an outlook for the future of clinical vaccine trials will be discussed.},

  abstract = {The microaerophilic bacterium Helicobacter pylori is well established for its role in development of different gastric diseases. Bacterial adhesins and corresponding binding sites on the epithelial surface allow H. pylori to colonize the gastric tissue. In this investigation, the adhesion of H. pylori to dot blot arrays of natural glycoproteins and neoglycoproteins was studied. Adhesion was detected by overlay with fluorescence-labeled bacteria on immobilized (neo)glycoproteins. The results confirmed the interaction between the adhesin BabA and the H-1-, Lewis b-, and related fucose-containing antigens. In addition, H. pylori bound to terminal alpha2-3-linked sialic acids as previously described. The use of a sabA mutant and sialidase treatment of glycoconjugate arrays showed that the adherence of H. pylori to laminin is mediated by the sialic acid-binding adhesin, SabA. The adhesion to salivary mucin MUC5B is mainly associated with the BabA adhesin and to a lesser extent with the SabA adhesin. This agrees with reports, that MUC5B carries both fucosylated blood group antigens and alpha2-3-linked sialic acids. The adhesion of H. pylori to fibronectin and lactoferrin persisted in the babA/sabA double mutant. Because binding to these molecules was abolished by denaturation rather than by deglycosylation, it was suggested to depend on the recognition of unknown receptor moieties by an additional unknown bacterial surface component. The results demonstrate that the bacterial overlay method on glycoconjugate arrays is a useful tool for exploration and the characterization of unknown adhesin specificities of H. pylori and other bacteria.},

METHODS: A total of 711 patients with different gastric lesions were recruited to determine the presence of H pylori infection and cytotoxin associated protein A (CagA), the presence of T helper (Th) cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), expression of plasma cytokines, and RNA and protein expression of IFN-gamma and IL-4 in gastric biopsies and PBMCs were determined by rapid urease test, urea [(14)C] breath test, immunoblotting test, flow cytometry , real time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Of the patients, 629 (88.47\%) were infected with H pylori; 506 (71.16\%) with CagA+ and 123 (17.30\%) with CagA- strains. Among patients infected with CagA+ H pylori strains, Th1-mediated cellular immunity was associated with earlier stages of gastric carcinogenesis, while Th2-mediated humoral immunity dominated the advanced stages and was negatively associated with an abundance of Treg cells. However, there was no such tendency in Th1/Th2 polarization in patients infected with CagA- H pylori strains and those without H pylori infection. CONCLUSION: Polarization of Th cell immune responses occurs in patients with CagA+ H pylori infection, which is associated with the stage and severity of gastric pathology during the progression of gastric carcinogenesis. This finding provides further evidence for a causal role of CagA+ H pylori infection in the immunopathogenesis of gastric cancer.},

This review will discuss different subsets of Treg cells, the factors that contribute to Treg cell generation and suppressive function, and the ability of signaling through Toll-like receptor 8 to reverse the suppressive function of Treg cells. Importantly, this TLR pathway does not depend on interaction with dendritic cells, but operates independently in Treg cells, relying on TLR8 (with MyD88 as its sole receptor-proximal adaptor) to transduce signals generated by TLR8 ligands. Linking TLR signaling to the functional control of Treg cells opens intriguing opportunities to shift the balance between CD4(+) T-helper and Treg cells, in ways that may improve the outcome of cancer immunotherapy.},

Here, we show that H. pylori replicates in murine bone marrow derived-dendritic cells (BMDCs) within autophagosomes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A 10-fold increase of CFU is found between 2 h and 6 h p.i. in H. pylori-infected BMDCs. Autophagy is induced around the bacterium and participates at late time points of infection for the clearance of intracellular H. pylori. As a consequence of infection, LC3, LAMP1 and MHC class II molecules are retained within the H. pylori-containing vacuoles and export of MHC class II molecules to cell surface is blocked. However, formalin-fixed H. pylori still maintain this inhibitory activity in BMDC derived from wild type mice, but not in from either TLR4 or TLR2-deficient mice, suggesting the involvement of H. pylori-LPS in this process. TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-10 expression was also modulated upon infection showing a TLR2-specific dependent IL-10 secretion. No IL-12 was detected favoring the hypothesis of a down modulation of DC functions during H. pylori infection. Furthermore, antigen-specific T cells proliferation was also impaired upon infection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: H. pylori can infect and replicate in BMDCs and thereby affects DC-mediated immune responses. The implication of this new finding is discussed for the biological life cycle of H. pylori in the host.},

METHODS: We used individual level data from 1308 patients with BE (cases), 1388 population-based controls, and 1775 GERD controls in the Barrett's and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON). We estimated study-specific odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% CIs using multivariable logistic regression models and obtained summary risk estimates using a random-effects meta-analytic approach. We examined potential effect modification by waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI), and smoking status by conducting stratified analyses. RESULTS: For comparisons with population-based controls, H. pylori infection was inversely associated with the risk of BE (adjusted OR\,=\,0.44, 95\% CI\,=\,0.36-0.55), with no evidence of between-study heterogeneity (I2\,=\,0\%). A stronger inverse association between H. pylori and BE was observed among individuals with the CagA-positive strain (P for interaction\,=\,0.017). We found no evidence of interaction between WHR, BMI, smoking status, and H. pylori infection on the risk of BE. There was no association between H. pylori infection and BE for comparisons with GERD controls (OR\,=\,0.96, 95\% CI\,=\,0.67-1.37; I2\,=\,48\%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the strongest evidence yet that H. pylori infection is strongly inversely associated with BE. This effect is probably mediated by a decrease in GERD in infected patients, since the protective effect disappears in patients with GERD symptoms.},

In the present study, we explore further the possible effect of IL-39 on murine lupus. We found that IL-39 in vitro and in vivo induces differentiation and/or expansion of neutrophils. GL7+ B cells up-regulated neutrophils by secreting IL-39, whereas IL-39-deficient GL7+ B cells lost the capacity to up-regulate neutrophils in lupus-prone mice and homozygous CD19cre (CD19-deficient) mice. Finally, we found that IL-39-induced neutrophils had a positive feedback on IL-39 expression in activated B cells by secreting B cell activation factor (BAFF). Taken together, our results suggest that IL-39 induces differentiation and/or expansion of neutrophils in lupus-prone mice.},

This study describes a novel means to control IL-23 secretion by conditioning DC with a phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase inhibitor Wortmannin (WM). Treatment of monocyte-derived DC with WM increased Toll-like receptor (TLR) -dependent IL-23 secretion 10-fold and IL-12p70 twofold, but IL-27 was unaffected. The effect of WM was restricted to TLR3/4 pathways, did not occur through TLR2, TLR7/8 or Dectin-1, and was characterized by increased p19, p35 and p40 transcription. These responses were not solely dependent on phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase as the alternative inhibitor LY294002 did not modulate IL-23 production. The normal patterns of activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways were unaffected by WM-conditioning but IL-23 secretion required p38, ERK and JNK pathways. Importantly, this effect was manifest in populations of blood DC. Conditioning freshly isolated myeloid DC with WM before TLR3 or TLR4 triggering resulted in high levels of IL-23 secretion and an absence of IL-12p70. These WM-conditioned myeloid DC were highly effective at priming Th17 responses from naive CD4(+) T cells. Our findings provide a novel means to generate IL-23-rich environments and Th17 responses and suggest as yet unidentified regulatory factors, identification of which will provide new approaches to control IL-23-dependent immunity in infectious disease, autoimmunity and malignancy.},

Increasing evidence shows that eradication of H. pylori with antibiotic therapy can lead to regression of gastric MALT lymphoma and can result in a 10-year sustained remission. The eradication of H. pylori is the standard care for patients with gastric MALT lymphoma. Cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) protein, one of the most extensively studied H. pylori virulence factors, is strongly associated with the gastric MALT lymphoma. CagA possesses polymorphisms according to its C-terminal structure and displays different functions among areas and races. After being translocated into B lymphocytes via type IV secretion system, CagA deregulates intracellular signaling pathways in both tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent and -independent manners and/or some other pathways, and thereby promotes lymphomagenesis. A variety of proteins including p53 and protein tyrosine phosphatases-2 are involved in the malignant transformation induced by CagA. Mucosal inflammation is the foundational mechanism underlying the occurrence and development of gastric MALT lymphoma.},

Several aspects of Helicobacter pylori physiology were newly explored this year and evaluated for their functions during stomach colonization, including a fascinating role for the essential protease HtrA in allowing access of H.~pylori to the basolateral side of the gastric epithelium through cleavage of the tight junction protein E-cadherin to facilitate CagA delivery. Molecular biology tools standard in model bacteria, including regulated gene expression during animal infection and fluorescent reporter gene fusions, were newly applied to H.~pylori to explore functions for urease beyond initial colonization and establish high salt consumption as a mediator of gene expression changes. New sequencing technologies enabled validation of long postulated roles for DNA methylation in regulating H.~pylori gene expression. On the cell biology side, elegant work using lineage tracing in the murine model and organoid primary cell culture systems has provided new insights into how H.~pylori manipulates gastric tissue functions, locally and at a distance, to promote its survival in the stomach and induce pathologic changes. Finally, new work has bolstered the case for genomic variation as an important mechanism to generate phenotypic diversity during changing environmental conditions in the context of diet manipulation in animal infection models and during human experimental infection after vaccination.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS Helicobacter pylori infection results in a diversity of pathologies, from asymptomatic gastritis to adenocarcinoma. The reason for these diverse outcomes is multifactorial and includes host factors that regulate severity of Helicobacter-induced gastritis. Protease-activated receptors (PAR) are environmental sensors that can detect tissue damage and pathogens. Whereas PAR-2 has proinflammatory activity and PAR-1 can protect the gastric mucosa against chemical damage, neither has previously been examined for their potential roles in regulating Helicobacter pathogenesis. METHODS PAR-1(-/-), PAR-2(-/-), and wild-type mice were infected with H pylori for up to 2 months then colonization levels determined by colony-forming assay, gastritis by histology, and serum antibody levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Responsiveness of primary epithelial cells to PAR-1 activation was assessed by calcium mobilization assay. Primary epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells were cocultured with H pylori and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and cytokine secretion was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS Two months postinfection, H pylori levels were significantly reduced in PAR-1(-/-) and increased in PAR-2(-/-) mice. This effect on colonization was inversely correlated with inflammation severity. Infection of PAR-1(-/-) mice induced an increased serum antibody response. Primary epithelial cells were activated by a PAR-1-activating peptide. H pylori stimulation of primary epithelial cells, but not macrophages or dendritic cells, from PAR-1(-/-) mice induced increased levels of NF-kappaB and the proinflammatory cytokine macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-2. PAR-1 also down-regulated MIP-2 secretion in response to cag pathogenicity island activity. CONCLUSIONS PAR-1 protects the host against severe Helicobacter-induced gastritis. This may be mediated by suppressing the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as MIP-2.},

  abstract = {Vibrio cholerae infection provides long-lasting protective immunity, while oral, inactivated cholera vaccines (OCV) result in more-limited protection. To identify characteristics of the innate immune response that may distinguish natural V. cholerae infection from OCV, we stimulated differentiated, macrophage-like THP-1 cells with live versus heat-inactivated V. cholerae with and without endogenous or exogenous cholera holotoxin (CT). Interleukin 23A gene (IL23A) expression was higher in cells exposed to live V. cholerae than in cells exposed to inactivated organisms (mean change, 38-fold; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 4.0 to 42; P\,{$<$}\,0.01). IL-23 secretion was also higher in cells exposed to live V. cholerae than in cells exposed to inactivated V. cholerae (mean change, 5.6-fold; 95\% CI, 4.4 to 11; P\,{$<$}\,0.001). This increase in IL-23 secretion was more marked than for other key innate immune cytokines (e.g., IL-1{$\beta$} and IL-6) and dependent on exposure to the combination of both live V. cholerae and CT. While IL-23 secretion was reduced following stimulation with either heat-inactivated wild-type V. cholerae or a live isogenic ctxAB mutant of V. cholerae, the addition of exogenous CT restored IL-23 secretion in combination with the live isogenic ctxAB mutant V. cholerae, but not when it was paired with stimulation by heat-inactivated V. cholerae The posttranslational regulation of IL-23 under these conditions was dependent on the activity of the cysteine protease cathepsin B. In humans, IL-23 promotes the differentiation of Th17 cells to T follicular helper cells, which maintain and support long-term memory B cell generation after infection. Based on these findings, the stimulation of IL-23 production may be a determinant of protective immunity following V. cholerae infection.IMPORTANCE An episode of cholera provides better protection against reinfection than oral cholera vaccines, and the reasons for this are still under study. To better understand this, we compared the immune responses of human cells exposed to live Vibrio cholerae with those of cells exposed to heat-killed V. cholerae (similar to the contents of oral cholera vaccines). We also compared the effects of active cholera toxin and the inactive cholera toxin B subunit (which is included in some cholera vaccines). One key immune signaling molecule, IL-23, was uniquely produced in response to the combination of live bacteria and active cholera holotoxin. Stimulation with V. cholerae that did not produce the active toxin or was killed did not produce an IL-23 response. The stimulation of IL-23 production by cholera toxin-producing V. cholerae may be important in conferring long-term immunity after cholera.},

In addition to Treg cells, whether a newly defined B cell subset, IL-10-producing B cells, is involved is still unknown. Using a mouse model of H. pylori infection, we investigated the dynamic changes of IL-10-producing B cells and Foxp3+Treg cells in gastrointestinal mucosa, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes following H. pylori infection. We observed that in addition to Foxp3+Treg cells, IL-10-producing B cells could also be induced after H. pylori infection and they expanded earlier than Foxp3+Treg cells did; Moreover, the regulatory immune responses induced by H. pylori were not limited to gastric mucosa. Our findings may provide new clues for further research on H. pylori immune evasion and diseases associated with H. pylori infection. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Produced by dendritic cells and macrophages, this cytokine promotes the protection of the host against mucosal pathogens through the induction of IL-17 and related cytokines by lymphoid cells. Preclinical disease models and association studies in humans have also clearly demonstrated the implication of IL-23 signalling pathway in inflammatory diseases. Indeed, this cytokine is now considered as a major therapeutic target in immune-based pathologies such as psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis or Crohn's disease. Furthermore, in the context of inflammation-related cancer, IL-23 is thought to contribute to tumorigenesis and progression to metastatic disease. Herein, we review our current understanding of IL-23 regulation at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. We discuss the relevance of these findings in the context of infection, chronic inflammation and cancer.},

  abstract = {We have previously reported that compromised interleukin 17A (IL-17A) production in the lungs increased susceptibility to infection with the invasive fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Here we have shown that culturing lung cells from A. fumigatus-challenged mice ex vivo demonstrated Dectin-1-dependent IL-17A production. In this system, neutralization of IL-23 but not IL-6, IL-1{$\beta$}, or IL-18 resulted in attenuated IL-17A production. Il23 mRNA expression was found to be lower in lung cells from A. fumigatus-challenged Dectin-1-deficient mice, whereas bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from Dectin-1-deficient mice failed to produce IL-23 in response to A. fumigatus in vitro. Addition of recombinant IL-23 augmented IL-17A production by wild-type (WT) and Dectin-1-deficient lung cells, although the addition of IL-6 or IL-1{$\beta$} did not augment the effect of IL-23. Intracellular cytokine staining of lung cells revealed lower levels of CD11b(+) IL-17A(+) and Ly-6G(+) IL-17A(+) cells in A. fumigatus-challenged Dectin-1-deficient mice. Ly-6G(+) neutrophils purified from the lungs of A. fumigatus-challenged Dectin-1-deficient mice displayed lower Il17a mRNA expression but surprisingly had intact Rorc and Rora mRNA expression. We further demonstrated that Ly-6G(+) neutrophils required the presence of myeloid cells for IL-17A production. Finally, upon in vitro stimulation with A. fumigatus, thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal neutrophils were positive for intracellular IL-17A expression and produced IL-17A in a Dectin-1- and IL-23-dependent manner. In summary, Dectin-1-dependent IL-17A production in the lungs during invasive fungal infection is mediated in part by CD11b(+) Ly-6G(+) neutrophils in an IL-23-dependent manner.},

In order to investigate the current seroprevalence of H. pylori infection in the area of Magdeburg, a city of the former East Germany, H. pylori antibodies of patients presenting in our emergency wards were analyzed. In total, 2,318 patients (1,181 males and 1,137 females) enrolled between September 2009 and August 2010 were tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) against H. pylori and anti-CagA antibodies by specific enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Patients with either anti-H. pylori IgG or anti-CagA antibodies were classified as H. pylori positive, whereas the lack of both antibodies led to the assignment of an H. pylori-negative status. The overall seroprevalence of H. pylori infection was 44.4\% (n = 1,029 out of 2,318) and did not differ in relation to sex. The proportion of CagA-positive samples was 43.3\% of all H. pylori-positive individuals (446 out of 1,029). The seroprevalence showed a birth cohort effect (0 to 20 years of age, 14.6\%; 21 to 30 years, 22.4\%; 31 to 40 years, 40.6\%; 41 to 50 years, 45.5\%; 51 to 60 years, 50.8\%) up to the age of 60, while it remained between 40.7\% and 50.5\% for the following decades. Patients younger than 30 years were significantly less H. pylori positive (21.1\%) than those older than 30 years of age (47.7\%; P {$<$} 0.01), whereas CagA status was similar (44.3 versus 43.3\%). Notably, young women ({$<$}30 years old) had significantly higher CagA positivity (59.3\%) than corresponding men (32.5\%; P = 0.016). Taken together, seroprevalence of H. pylori infection shows a significant drop in subjects born after 1980 in Saxony-Anhalt but still remains in the range of 40 to 50\% in subjects born earlier.},

The subsequent use of two methods, (i) a phenol/chloroform extraction and (ii) a column-based extraction method, resulted in a yield of 4.5 microg total RNA per biopsy with reliable quality in 80\% of samples. The quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that only RNA samples that clearly show both 18S- and 28S-RNA bands in agarose gel electrophoresis were suitable for quantitative RT-PCR as shown by expression of corpus-specific pepsinogen C-mRNA and the duodenum-specific multi-drug resistance protein-1 (mdr-1)-mRNA. In partially degraded RNA, pepsinogen C, mdr-1, or beta-actin mRNAs were still detectable, but the quantitative determination gave inconsistent data.

During endoscopy, multiple biopsies from gastroesophageal mucosa were obtained for routine histopathology (Helicobacter pylori-status, inflammation) and gene expression analysis (immunohistochemistry, ELISA). Patients with GERD presented with typical histopathological alterations like elongation of papillae (P=0.015), basal cell hyperplasia (P{$<$}0.001) and dilatation of intercellular spaces (P=0.002). Zonulin was found to be expressed ubiquitously in gastroesophageal mucosa. Mucosal levels in controls ranged between 2.2 and 3.7 ng/microg total protein. Mean values were significantly higher in antrum (3.3+/-1.7 ng/microg) than cardia (2.7+/-1.2n g/microg) and esophagus (2.2+/-1.3 ng/microg) (P{$<$}0.001), but did not differ between GERD and controls for cardia and esophageal mucosa. Immunohistochemistry revealed that predominantly epithelial cells but not stromal cells contribute to the zonulin expression in gastroesophageal mucosa. In conclusion, despite its established role for intestinal permeability, Zonulin seems not to be involved in the regulation of epithelial barrier function in relation to GERD.},

METHODS: Parental infection (at birth) and children's infection (at age 3 years) were determined by C-urea breath test and by monoclonal antigen stool test. RESULTS: Twenty of 834 children (2.4\%) were found to be infected. The odds ratio for H. pylori infection of the child was 12.9 (95\% confidence interval = 3.2-52.5) if the mother was infected and 1.4 (0.4-4.6) if the father was infected, after adjustment for infection status of the other parent and for nationality. The number of older siblings was not a risk factor for H. pylori infection of the child. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study suggests that infected mothers are the main source of H. pylori infection of their children.},

Additionally, top-down sequencing of proteins is another powerful approach to reveal comprehensive information for biological function. A commonly used fragmentation technique in MS-based peptide sequencing is CID. As CID often fails in PTM-analysis and performs best on doubly-charged, short and middle-sized peptides, confident peptide identification may be hampered. A newly developed fragmentation technique, namely electron transfer dissociation (ETD), supports both, PTM- and top-down analysis, and generally results in more confident identification of long, highly charged or modified peptides. The following review presents the theoretical background of ETD and its technical implementation in mass analyzers. Furthermore, current improvements of ETD and approaches for the PTM-analysis and top-down sequencing are introduced. Alternating both fragmentation techniques, ETD and CID, increases the amount of information derived from peptide fragmentation, thereby enhancing both, peptide sequence coverage and the confidence of peptide and protein identification.},

It was shown that the separation of protein glycoforms evident in 2D-PAGE is partially due to the combined sialylation of the O-linked and N-linked oligosaccharides. Bi-, tri- and tetra-antennary N-linked structures, which had differing levels of sialylation and fucosylation, were found to be present on the glycoproteins analyzed, together with O-linked oligosaccharides such as mono-, and disialylated T-antigen and a disialylated core type 2 hexasaccharide. In addition, N-linked site-specific information was obtained by MALDI-MS analysis using tryptic digestion after PNGase F release of the oligosaccharides.},

  abstract = {AIM: To evaluate the suitability of reference genes in gastric tissue samples and cell lines. METHODS: The suitability of genes ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, RPL29, and 18S rRNA was assessed in 21 matched pairs of neoplastic and adjacent non-neoplastic gastric tissues from patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, 27 normal gastric tissues from patients without cancer, and 4 cell lines using reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The ranking of the best single and combination of reference genes was determined by NormFinder, geNorm\texttrademark, BestKeeper, and DataAssist\texttrademark. In addition, GenEx software was used to determine the optimal number of reference genes. To validate the results, the mRNA expression of a target gene, DNMT1, was quantified using the different reference gene combinations suggested by the various software packages for normalization. RESULTS: ACTB was the best reference gene for all gastric tissues, cell lines and all gastric tissues plus cell lines. GAPDH + B2M or ACTB + B2M was the best combination of reference genes for all the gastric tissues. On the other hand, ACTB + B2M was the best combination for all the cell lines tested and was also the best combination for analyses involving all the gastric tissues plus cell lines. According to the GenEx software, 2 or 3 genes were the optimal number of references genes for all the gastric tissues. The relative quantification of DNMT1 showed similar patterns when normalized by each combination of reference genes. The level of expression of DNMT1 in neoplastic, adjacent non-neoplastic and normal gastric tissues did not differ when these samples were normalized using GAPDH + B2M (P = 0.32), ACTB + B2M (P = 0.61), or GAPDH + B2M + ACTB (P = 0.44). CONCLUSION: GAPDH + B2M or ACTB + B2M is the best combination of reference gene for all the gastric tissues, and ACTB + B2M is the best combination for the cell lines tested.},

  abstract = {IL-17 is a newly discovered cytokine implicated in the regulation of hemopoiesis and inflammation. Because IL-17 production is restricted to activated T lymphocytes, the effects exerted by IL-17 may help one to understand the contribution of T cells to the inflammatory response. We investigated the role of IL-17 in leukocyte recruitment into the peritoneal cavity. Leukocyte infiltration in vivo was assessed in BALB/Cj mice. Effects of IL-17 on chemokine generation in vitro were examined in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC). Administration of IL-17 i.p. resulted in a selective recruitment of neutrophils into the peritoneum and increased levels of KC chemokine (murine homologue of human growth-related oncogene alpha (GROalpha). Pretreatment with anti-KC Ab significantly reduced the IL-17-driven neutrophil accumulation. Primary cultures of HPMC expressed IL-17 receptor mRNA. Exposure of HPMC to IL-17 led to a dose- and time-dependent induction of GROalpha mRNA and protein. Combination of IL-17 together with TNF-alpha resulted in an increased stability of GROalpha mRNA and synergistic release of GROalpha protein. Anti-IL-17 Ab blocked the effects of IL-17 in vitro and in vivo. IL-17 is capable of selectively recruiting neutrophils into the peritoneal cavity via the release of neutrophil-specific chemokines from the peritoneal mesothelium.},

The studies presented in this article show that mice that overexpress IL-27 had decreased Treg frequencies and developed spontaneous inflammation. Although IL-27 did not cause mature Tregs to downregulate forkhead box P3, transgenic overexpression in vivo limited the size of a differentiating Treg population in a bone marrow chimera model, which correlated with reduced production of IL-2, a vital cytokine for Treg maintenance.

To evaluate the effect of a selective COX-2 inhibitor alone and combined with H pylori eradication on the evolution of precancerous gastric lesions, a randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Linqu County, Shandong Province, China. METHODS: A total of 1024 participants aged 35-64 years with H pylori infection and advanced gastric lesions were randomly assigned in a factorial design to two interventions or placebo: anti-H pylori treatment for 7 days, and a COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) for 24 months. The effects of the interventions were evaluated by the regression or progression of advanced gastric lesions. RESULTS: Of the 1024 participants who received anti-H pylori treatment or placebo, 919 completed a subsequent 24-month treatment with celecoxib or placebo. The H pylori eradication rate by per-protocol analysis was 78.2\%. Compared with placebo, the proportions of regression of gastric lesions significantly increased in the celecoxib treatment (52.8\% vs 41.2\%) and anti-H pylori treatment (59.3\% vs 41.2\%) group, and OR by per-protocol analysis was 1.72 (95\% CI 1.07 to 2.76) for celecoxib and 2.19 (95\% CI 1.32 to 3.64) for H pylori eradication. No statistically significant effect was found for H pylori eradication followed by celecoxib on the regression of advanced gastric lesions (OR 1.48, 95\% CI 0.91 to 2.40). CONCLUSION: This population-based intervention trial revealed that celecoxib treatment or H pylori eradication alone had beneficial effects on the regression of advanced gastric lesions. No favourable effects were seen for H pylori eradication followed by celecoxib treatment. Trial registration HARECCTR0500053 in accordance with WHO ICTRP requirements.},

They are a break in the mucosal barrier of the stomach lining that penetrates through the muscularis mucosa and are greater than 5 mm in diameter. It is important to understand this disease process is both preventable and treatable. Patients may be treated differently depending on the etiology of their gastric ulcer. The body has natural ways to protect the stomach mucosa from the harmful acidic environment~that is the gastric lumen. When alterations occur to these defenses, it can lead to changes in the gastric mucosa which will eventually cause erosion and then ulceration. Gastric mucosa protection is via prostaglandins, mucous, growth factors, and adequate blood flow. Known damaging factors of this barrier include smoking, hydrochloric acid, ischemia, NSAID medications, hypoxia, alcohol, and Helicobacter pylori infection.},

IL-17F is a disulfide-linked dimer that contains a cysteine-knot motif. We hypothesized that IL-17F and IL-17A could form a heterodimer due to their sequence homology and overlapping pattern of expression. We evaluated the structure of recombinant IL-17F and IL-17A proteins, as well as that of natural IL-17F and IL-17A derived from activated human CD4+ T cells, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting, and mass spectrometry. We find that both IL-17F and IL-17A can form both homodimeric and heterodimeric proteins when expressed in a recombinant system, and that all forms of the recombinant proteins have in vitro functional activity. Furthermore, we find that in addition to the homodimers of IL-17F and IL-17A, activated human CD4+ T cells also produce the IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimer.

Increased epithelial tight junction permeability and alterations in apical-junctional complexes are also associated with an increased risk of carcinogenesis. Phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) by MLC kinase (MLCK) regulates tight junction function. We determined whether MLCK was activated by H pylori and defined the mechanisms through which such activation dysregulates gastric epithelial barrier function. METHODS: MKN28 gastric epithelial cells were cocultured with the H pylori cag(+) strain 60190 or cagA(-), cagE(-), ureB(-), or vacA(-) mutants. MLC phosphorylation and barrier integrity were determined by immunoblot analysis and transepithelial electrical resistance measurements, respectively. Localization of the tight junction protein occludin was determined by immunocytochemistry in MKN28 cells and INS-GAS mice. RESULTS: H pylori induced a progressive loss of barrier function that was attenuated by inactivation of ureB, but not cagA, cagE, or vacA. Reductions in transepithelial electrical resistance were also dependent on functional urease activity. H pylori increased MLC phosphorylation in epithelial monolayers; this was significantly decreased by inhibition of MLCK or Rho kinase or by loss of UreB. H pylori infection of either cultured monolayers or hypergastrinemic INS-GAS mice induced occludin endocytosis, reflecting cytoskeletally mediated disruption of tight junctions. CONCLUSIONS: H pylori increases MLC phosphorylation, occludin internalization and barrier dysfunction in gastric epithelial cells. This process requires functional urease activity and is independent of the cag pathogenicity island or VacA. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms by which H pylori disrupts gastric barrier function.},

  abstract = {Next to the identification of proteins and the determination of their expression levels, the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTM) is becoming an increasingly important aspect in proteomics. Here, we review mass spectrometric (MS) techniques for the study of protein glycosylation at the glycopeptide level. Enrichment and separation techniques for glycoproteins and glycopeptides from complex (glyco-)protein mixtures and digests are summarized. Various tandem MS (MS/MS) techniques for the analysis of glycopeptides are described and compared with respect to the information they provide on peptide sequence, glycan attachment site and glycan structure. Approaches using electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) of glycopeptides are presented and the following fragmentation techniques in glycopeptide analysis are compared: collision-induced fragmentation on different types of instruments, metastable fragmentation after MALDI ionization, infrared multi-photon dissociation, electron-capture dissociation and electron-transfer dissociation. This review discusses the potential and limitations of tandem mass spectrometry of glycopeptides as a tool in structural glycoproteomics.},

  abstract = {The interleukin-12 receptor (IL-12R)beta1 chain is an essential component of the functional IL-12R on both human T and natural killer cells. In this report it is shown that activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or phytohemagglutinin resulted in the up-regulation of IL-12Rbeta1 expression and IL-12 binding. Kinetic studies revealed that maximum expression of IL-12Rbeta1 and IL-12 binding occurred on days 3-4. Anti-CD3-induced expression of IL-12Rbeta1 chain and IL-12 binding by PBMC was augmented by anti-CD28 mAb, indicating that the potentiating effect of anti-CD28 on T cell responses to IL-12 could be mediated, at least in part, by the enhancement of IL-12R expression. Among 16 cytokines tested, IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 markedly induced IL-12Rbeta1 expression and IL-12 binding on resting PBMC, whereas IL-1alpha and tumor necrosis factor-alpha had a minimal enhancing effect. In contrast, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-gamma, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta2 had no detectable enhancing effect. Anti-CD3-induced expression of IL-12Rbeta1 and of low-affinity IL-12 binding sites was partially inhibited by TGF-beta2, IL-10 and IL-4; however, TGF-beta2 and IL-10 completely abolished anti-CD3-induced expression of high-affinity IL-12 binding sites. Consistent with the reduction of high affinity IL-12 binding sites, PBMC activated with anti-CD3 mAb in the presence of TGF-beta2 or IL-10 failed to produce IFN-gamma or to proliferate in response to IL-12. These results suggest that Th2 cell-derived cytokines can inhibit IL-12-induced biological functions by inhibiting IL-12R expression and that expression of a second subunit of the IL-12R (IL-12Rbeta2), required for the formation of high-affinity IL-12 binding sites, may be more highly regulated by TGF-beta2 and IL-10 than is expression of IL-12Rbeta1.},

Despite accumulating evidence for pathogenic and immunologic functions of H. pylori gGT, it is still unclear how it supports gastric colonization and how its specific effects on the host's innate and adaptive immune responses contribute to colonization and pathology. We have compared mice showing similar bacterial load after infection with gGT-proficient or gGT-deficient H. pylori to analyse the specific role of the enzyme during infection. Our data indicate that H. pylori gGT supports initial colonization. Nevertheless, bacteria lacking gGT can still colonize and persist. We observed that the presence of gGT during infection favoured a proinflammatory innate and adaptive immune response. Notably, H. pylori gGT activity was linked to increased levels of IFN{$\gamma$}, which were attributed to a differential recruitment of CD8+ T cells to the stomach. Our data support an essential role for H. pylori gGT in gastric colonization and further suggest that gGT favours infiltration of CD8+ cells to the gastric mucosa, which might play an important and yet overlooked role in the~pathogenesis of H. pylori.},

  abstract = {IL-23 is a newly discovered proinflammatory cytokine that contributes to the maintenance and expansion of Th17 cells. IL-23 has recently been identified as playing a critical role in a number of chronic inflammatory diseases. However, the regulatory mechanism of IL-23 in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains largely unknown. The aims of this study were to detect the expression of IL-23 in CHB patients and to explore the molecular mechanism of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced IL-23 expression. Serum levels and hepatic expression of IL-23 were significantly upregulated in CHB patients. A positive correlation was found between IL-23 expression and the histological activity index score, HBV DNA load, and serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels. HBx protein increased IL-23 expression in a dose-dependent manner. It also aided in the nuclear translocation of NF-{$\kappa$}B, which directly bound to the promoters of IL-23 subunits p19 and p40 to facilitate their transcription. NF-{$\kappa$}B inhibitors blocked the effect of HBx on IL-23 induction, and NF-{$\kappa$}B subunits p65 and p50 increased the augmented IL-23 expression. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activation and transfection with ERK dominant-negative plasmid significantly blocked the HBx-induced IL-23 expression. Furthermore, PI3K and Ras\textendash MEK\textendash MAPK inhibitors significantly decreased the ERK1/2 activation and IL-23 expression. Thus, we report a new molecular mechanism for HBV-induced IL-23 expression, which involves the activation of the ERK/NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway by HBx, leading to the transactivation of the IL-23 p19 and p40 promoters.},

  abstract = {AIM: To construct a recombinant live attenuated Salmonella typhimurium DNA vaccine encoding H pylori ureB gene and mouse IL-2 gene and to detect its immunogenicity in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: H pylori ureB and mouse IL-2 gene fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into pUCmT vector. DNA sequence of the amplified ureB and IL-2 genes was assayed, then cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pIRES through enzyme digestion and ligation reactions resulting in pIRES-ureB and pIRES-ureB-IL-2. The recombinant plasmids were used to transform competent E. coli DH5alpha, and the positive clones were screened by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. Then, the recombinant pIRES-ureB and pIRES-ureB-IL-2 were used to transform LB5000 and the recombinant plasmids extracted from LB5000 were finally introduced into the final host SL7207. After that, recombinant strains were grown in vitro repeatedly. In order to detect the immunogenicity of the vaccine in vitro, pIRES-ureB and pIRES-ureB-IL-2 were transfected to COS-7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000, the immunogenicity of expressed UreB and IL-2 proteins was assayed with SDS-PAGE and Western blot. C57BL/6 mice were orally immunized with 1 x 10(8) recombinant attenuated Salmonella typhimurium DNA vaccine. Four weeks after vaccination, mice were challenged with 1 x 10(7) CFU of live H pylori SS1. Mice were sacrificed and the stomach was isolated for examination of H pylori 4 wk post-challenge. RESULTS: The 1700 base pair ureB gene fragment amplified from the genomic DNA was consistent with the sequence of H pylori ureB by sequence analysis. The amplified 510 base pair fragment was consistent with the sequence of mouse IL-2 in gene bank. It was confirmed by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion that H pylori ureB and mouse IL-2 genes were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pIRES. The experiments in vitro showed that stable recombinant live attenuated Salmonella typhimurium DNA vaccine carrying ureB and IL-2 genes was successfully constructed and the specific strips of UreB and IL-2 expressed by recombinant plasmids were detected through Western blot. Study in vivo showed that the positive rate of rapid urease test of the immunized group including ureB and ureB-IL-2 was 37.5\% and 12.5\% respectively, and was significantly lower than that (100\%) in the control group (P{$<$}0.01). CONCLUSION: Recombinant attenuated Salmonella typhimurium DNA vaccine expressing UreB protein and IL-2 protein with immunogenicity can be constructed. It can protect mice against H pylori infection, which may help the development of a human-use H pylori DNA vaccine.},

The role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in IL-8 production by H. pylori has been examined in an in vitro study. IL-8 mRNA expression in gastric epithelial cells (MKN 28) was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). IL-8 production was examined by ELISA. The activation of p38 MAPK was assessed by western blotting. Neither IL-8 mRNA nor activated p38 MAPK or p44/42 MAPK was detected in cells not treated with H. pylori. In contrast, incubation of cells with H. pylori, or IL-1beta, or both, clearly stimulated the expression of IL-8 mRNA within 60 min in a concentration-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and p44/p42 MAPK, as well as IL-8 production, occurred within 30 min and 24 hr after co-culturing MKN 28 cells with H. pylori and IL-1beta, respectively. Pretreatment of cells with MAPK inhibitors [1-[7-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetra-hydro-8-pyridylpyrazolo[5,1-c][1,2,4]triazin-2-yl]-2-phenylethanedione sulfate monohydrate (FR167653), 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole (SB203580), or 2-(2'-amino-3'-methoxyphenyl)-oxanaphthalen-4-one (PD98059)] significantly inhibited IL-8 production stimulated by H. pylori or IL-1beta or both. The combination of H. pylori and IL-1beta additively stimulated IL-8 production. The additive effect of H. pylori and IL-1beta on IL-8 production was inhibited by treatment with a p38 MAPK inhibitor. It was revealed that the culturing of MKN 28 cells with H. pylori significantly stimulates IL-8 production to a degree sufficient for induction of neutrophil chemotaxis via activation of p38 and p44/42 MAPK.},

METHODS: There were consent 134 Thai non-cancer volunteers who underwent endoscopic narrow band imaging examination, and 86 Thais advance gastric cancer patients who underwent endoscopic mucosal biopsies and gastric surgery. Tissue samples were taken by endoscopy with 3 points biopsies. The serum PG\hspace{0.25em}I, II, and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody for H. pylori were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. The histopathology description of gastric cancer and non-cancer with H. pylori detection was defined with modified Sydney Score System. Gastric mucosal tissue H. pylori DNA was extracted and genotyped for cagA mutation. Tissue IL-8 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA expression were conducted by real time relative quantitation polymerase chain reaction. From 17 Japanese advance gastric cancer and 12 benign gastric tissue samples, all were tested for genetic expression with same methods as well as Thai gastric mucosal tissue samples. The multivariate analysis was used for the risk study. Correlation and standardized t-test were done for quantitative data, P value {$<$} 0.05 was considered as a statistically significant. RESULTS: There is a high non cagA gene of 86.8 per cent in Thai gastric cancer although there are high yields of the East Asian type in the positive cagA. The H. pylori infection prevalence in this study is reported by combined histopathology and H. pylori IgG antibody test with 77.1\% and 97.4\% of sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The serum PG\hspace{0.25em}I/II ratio in gastric cancer is significantly lower than in the non-cancer group, P = 0.045. The serum PG\hspace{0.25em}I/II ratio of less than 3.0 and IL-8 mRNA expression {$\geq$} 100 or log10 {$\geq$} 2 are significant cut off risk differences between Thai cancer and non-cancer, P = 0.03 and P {$<$} 0.001, respectively.

Serum PG\hspace{0.25em}I/II ratio at cut off less than 3.0 and IL-8 mRNA expression Raw RQ {$>$} 100 or log10 {$>$} 2 are significantly difference between Thai cancer group when compared to non-cancer group, P = 0.013 and P {$<$} 0.001, respectively. In the correlation study, low PG\hspace{0.25em}I/II ratio does not associate with chronic atrophic gastritis severity score in Thais non-cancer cases. However, there is a trend, but not significant convert correlation between IL-8 mRNA expression level and low PG\hspace{0.25em}I/II ratio in Thai positive H. pylori infection. The high expression of IL-8 gene demonstrates a poorer prognosis by stage and histology. CONCLUSION: Predominant gastric mucosal IL-8 mRNA expression level, H. pylori infection, and low PG\hspace{0.25em}I/II ratio are relative risks for Thai gastric cancer without correlation with cagA mutation.},

The aim was to determine which H. pylori virulence factor(s) was the most important predictor of severity of gastric inflammation or clinical outcome. METHODS: cag Pathogenicity island (PAI), vacA babA2, and iceA status were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). oipA functionality was based on switch status determined by PCR-based sequencing. A backward stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to determine which factor(s) was the most discriminating for clinical outcome as well as the relationship to mucosal histology (H. pylori density, neutrophil infiltration, intestinal metaplasia, and gastric atrophy) and mucosal interleukin 8 (IL-8) production. RESULTS: H. pylori were obtained from 247 patients (86 with gastritis, 86 with duodenal ulcer, and 75 with gastric carcinoma). Although oipA status was closely linked to specific cag PAI, vacA, and babA2 genotypes, only oipA status remained in the final model to discriminate duodenal ulcer from gastritis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5 and 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1-11.9). Among the factors, only a functional oipA was significantly associated with high H. pylori density, severe neutrophil infiltration, and high mucosal IL-8 levels (P {$<$} 0.001). oipA status had no relationship to gastric atrophic changes. CONCLUSIONS: oipA functional status was related to clinical presentation, H. pylori density, and gastric inflammation. cag PAI, babA2, or vacA status appear important only as surrogate markers for a functional oipA gene.},

Some populations that have a high prevalence of H. pylori infection also have a high incidence of gastric cancer (for example, in East Asia), whereas others do not (for example, in Africa and South Asia). Even within East Asia, the incidence of gastric cancer varies (decreasing in the south). H. pylori is a highly heterogeneous bacterium and its virulence varies geographically. Geographic differences in the incidence of gastric cancer can be explained, at least in part, by the presence of different types of H. pylori virulence factor, especially CagA, VacA and OipA. However, it is still unclear why the pathogenicity of H. pylori increased as it migrated from Africa to East Asia during the course of evolution. H. pylori infection is also thought to be involved in the development of duodenal ulcer, which is at the opposite end of the disease spectrum to gastric cancer. This discrepancy can be explained in part by the presence of H. pylori virulence factor DupA. Despite advances in our understanding of the development of H. pylori-related diseases, further work is required to clarify the roles of H. pylori virulence factors.},

  abstract = {The complete genome sequence revealed a family of 32 outer membrane proteins (OMPs) in Helicobacter pylori. We examined the effect of four OMPs (HP0638, HP0796, HP1501, and babA2) on the production of the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-8. Mutants of the four OMPs, as well as cagE and galE from H. pylori from the U.S. and Japan, were constructed by inserting a chloramphenicol-resistant cassette into the gene. Twenty-two pairs of parental and mutant H. pylori strains, as well as 160 clinical isolates (80 from Japanese and 80 from U.S.), were cocultured with gastric cancer cell lines. IL-8 production in the supernatant and adhesion was assayed by ELISA. HP0796, HP1501, babA2, and galE gene knockouts had no significant effect on IL-8 production. Knockout of the HP0638 gene in 81\% of cag-positive strains reduced IL-8 production approximately 50\%. The three cag-positive strains in which IL-8 levels were unchanged by HP0638 knockout had five or seven CT dinucleotide repeats in the 5{${'}$} region, resulting in a frame shift and truncation. Strains with naturally inactive HP0638 gene were all from the U.S.; Japanese strains were always ``on'' and thus, on average, may be more virulent. Although cag-negative isolates produced a limited IL-8 response, cag-negative strains that contained a functional HP0638 gene produced more than 3-fold greater IL-8 than cag-negative nonfunctional HP0638 strains. We hypothesize that functional HP0638 gene may be an important virulence factor in relation to the risk of clinically significant outcomes of H. pylori infection. We denote HP0638 gene as outer inflammatory protein (oipA).},

  abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is a major human pathogen that infects the stomach and produces inflammation that is responsible for various gastroduodenal diseases. Despite the high prevalence of H. pylori infections in Africa and South Asia, the incidence of gastric cancer in these areas is much lower than in other countries. The incidence of gastric cancer also tends to decrease from north to south in East Asia. Data from molecular epidemiological studies show that this variation in different geographic areas could be explained in part by different types of H. pylori virulence factors, especially CagA, VacA, and OipA. H. pylori infection is thought to be involved in both gastric cancer and duodenal ulcer, which are at opposite ends of the disease spectrum. This discrepancy can also be explained in part by another H. pylori factor, DupA, as well as by CagA typing (East Asian type versus Western type). H. pylori has a genome of approximately 1,600 genes; therefore, there might be other novel virulence factors. Because genome wide analyses using whole-genome sequencing technology give a broad view of the genome of H. pylori, we hope that next-generation sequencers will enable us to efficiently investigate novel virulence factors.},

It has been proposed that iceA and cagA genes are such markers and can identify patients with peptic ulcers. We compared H. pylori isolates from four countries, looking at the cagA and vacA genotypes, iceA alleles, and presentation of the infection. We used PCR to examine iceA, vacA, and cagA status of 424 H. pylori isolates obtained from patients with different clinical presentations (peptic ulcer, gastric cancer, and atrophic gastritis). The H. pylori isolates examined included 107 strains from Bogota, Colombia, 70 from Houston, Tex., 135 from Seoul, Korea, and 112 from Kyoto, Japan. The predominant genotype differed among countries: the cagA-positive iceA1 vacA s1c-m1 genotype was predominant in Japan and Korea, the cagA-positive iceA2 vacA s1b-m1 genotype was predominant in the United States, and the cagA-positive iceA2 vacA s1a-m1 genotype was predominant in Colombia. There was no association between the iceA, vacA, or cagA status and clinical outcome in patients in the countries studied. iceA status shows considerable geographic differences, and neither iceA nor combinations of iceA, vacA, and cagA were helpful in predicting the clinical presentation of an H. pylori infection.},

We investigated IL-18 levels in gastric mucosal biopsy specimens as well as in isolated gastric epithelial cells and lamina propria mononuclear cells. We also investigated IL-18 levels in gastric epithelial cells and the monocyte cell line THP-1 cocultured with H. pylori. In both systems, IL-18 levels were markedly enhanced in H. pylori-infected epithelial cells and monocytes. IL-18 levels in H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa were well correlated with the severity of gastric inflammation, confirming that H. pylori-induced IL-18 plays an important role in gastric injury. Virulence factors of H. pylori; the cag pathogenicity island and OipA affected IL-18 induction in different manners. Up-regulation of IL-18 mRNA/protein in epithelial cells was dependent on both virulence factors. Interestingly, up-regulation of IL-18 mRNA in monocytes was independent of both factors, whereas IL-18 protein was OipA dependent-cag pathogenicity island independent, indicating that OipA regulates IL-18 induction in monocytes at the posttranscriptional level. IL-18 levels in the gastric biopsy specimens showed similar patterns to those in lamina propria mononuclear cells with respect to virulence factors, suggesting that submucosal monocytes/macrophages are the main source of IL-18 induced by H. pylori infection. H. pylori appeared to regulate the ERK/JNK--{$>$}AP-1 pathway in both cell types. In addition, OipA and its related p38 pathway may be closely involved in IL-18 induction in H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa and may contribute to gastric injury.},

We investigated these phenomena in in vivo human gastric mucosa. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA and CagA-coimmunoprecipitated SHP-2 were detected in gastric mucosa from H. pylori-positive patients with atrophic gastritis and in noncancerous tissues from H. pylori-positive patients with early gastric cancer. In contrast, CagA was not detected in gastric mucosa with either intestinal metaplasia or cancer. Our results provide the first evidence that CagA is translocated into the gastric epithelial cells, receives tyrosine phosphorylation, and binds SHP-2 in in vivo human gastric mucosa. Deregulation of SHP-2 by CagA may play a role in the acquisition of a cellular-transformed phenotype at a relatively early stage of multistep gastric carcinogenesis.},

  abstract = {AIM: To investigate the frequencies of the expression of main protein antigens of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) isolates, such as UreB, VacA, CagA1, HpaA, NapA, FlaA and FlaB and the production of specific antibodies in sera from H pylori-infected patients, and to understand the correlations among the different clinical types of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer and the infection and virulence of H pylori. METHODS: H pylori strains in biopsy specimens from 157 patients with chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer were isolated and serum samples from the patients were also collected. The target recombinant proteins rUreB, rVacA, rCagA1, rHpaA, rNapA, rFlaA and rFlaB expressed by the prokaryotic expression systems constructed in our previous studies were collected through Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Rabbit antisera against rUreB, rVacA, rCagA1, rHpaA, rNapA, rFlaA and rFlaB were prepared by using routine subcutaneous immunization. By using ultrasonic lysates of the isolates as coated antigens, and the self-prepared rabbit antisera as the first antibodies and commercial HRP-labeling sheep anti-rabbit IgG as the second antibody, expression frequencies of the seven antigens in the isolates were detected by ELISA. Another ELISA was established to detect antibodies against the seven antigens in sera of the patients by using the corresponding recombinant proteins as coated antigens, and the sera as the first antibody and HRP-labeling sheep anti-human IgG as the second antibody respectively. Correlations among the different clinical types of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer and the infection and virulence of H pylori were statistically analysed. RESULTS: In the 125 isolates of H pylori, the positive rates of UreB, VacA, CagA1, HpaA, NapA, FlaA and FlaB were 100\%, 65.6\%, 92.8\%, 100\%, 93.6\%, 100\% and 99.2\% respectively. In the 125 serum samples from the H pylori-infected patients, the positive rates of antibodies against recombinant UreB, VacA, CagA1, HpaA, NapA, FlaA and FlaB were 100\%, 42.4\%, 89.6\%, 81.6\%, 93.6\%, 98.4\% and 92.8\% respectively. H pylori strains were isolated from 79.6\% (125/157) of the biopsy specimens, but no close correlations among the H pylori infection frequencies and different types of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer could be found (P{$>$}0.05, chi2 = 0.01-0.87). The VacA positive rate (82.40\%) in the strains isolated from the specimens of patients with peptic ulcer and the anti-VacA positive rate (54.3\%) in the sera from the patients were significantly higher than those (51.5\%, 32.3\%) from the patients with chronic gastritis (P{$<$}0.01, chi2 = 13.19; P{$<$}0.05, chi2 = 6.13). When analysis was performed in the different types of chronic gastritis, the VacA in the strains isolated from the specimems of patients with active gastritis showed a higher expression frequency (90.0\%) than those from superficial (47.9\%) and atrophic gastritis (30.0\%) (P{$<$}0.05, chi2 = 5.93; P{$<$}0.01, chi2 = 7.50). While analysis was carried out in the strains isolated from the specimens with superficial (93.8\%) and active gastritis (100\%), NapA showed a higher expression frequency compared to that from atrophic gastritis (60.0\%) (P{$<$}0.01, chi2 = 8.88; P{$<$}0.05, chi2 = 5.00). CONCLUSION: The types of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer and their severity are not associated with H pylori infection frequency but closely related to the infection frequency of different virulent H pylori strains. The optimal antigens for developing vaccine and diagnostic kit are UreB, FlaA, HpaA, FlaB, NapA and CagA1, but not VacA.},

However, no EBI3, p28 or p35-deficiency studies that directly address the role of EBI3, p28 or p35 on Th17 cells have been done. Here, we demonstrate that spleen cells derived from EBI3(-/-) mice produce significantly higher levels of IL-17 as well as IL-22 upon stimulation with OVA. In vitro derived EBI3(-/-) Th17 cells also produced significantly higher levels of IL-17 and IL-22 than WT cells. The frequency of IL-17-producing cells was also elevated when EBI3(-/-) cells were cultured under Th17 conditions. In addition, spleen cells from EBI3(-/-) mice immunized with Listeria monocytogenes produced significantly elevated levels of IL-17 and IL-22. Furthermore, the Th17 transcription factor RORgamma t was significantly enhanced in EBI3(-/-) cells. Finally, EBI3(-/-) mice exhibited a reduced bacterial load following an acute challenge with L. monocytogenes or a re-challenge of previously immunized mice, suggesting that EBI3 negatively regulates both innate and adaptive immunity. Taken together, these data provide direct evidence that EBI3 negatively regulates the expression of IL-17, IL-22 and RORgamma t as well as protective immunity against L. monocytogenes.},

Here, we report Th17 cells highly expressed another related nuclear receptor, ROR alpha, induced by transforming growth factor-beta and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is dependent on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. Overexpression of ROR alpha promoted Th17 differentiation, possibly through the conserved noncoding sequence 2 in Il17-Il17f locus. ROR alpha deficiency resulted in reduced IL-17 expression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ROR alpha and ROR gamma coexpression synergistically led to greater Th17 differentiation. Double deficiencies in ROR alpha and ROR gamma globally impaired Th17 generation and completely protected mice against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Therefore, Th17 differentiation is directed by two lineage-specific nuclear receptors, ROR alpha and ROR gamma.},

Antibiotic treatment of H. pylori is becoming less effective because of increasing antibiotic resistance; other treatment approaches such as specifically targeted methods, etc. to destroy this organism would be beneficial. An epitope vaccine is a promising option for protection against H. pylori infection. In this study, a multi-epitope vaccine was constructed by linking cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), two antigenic fragments of H. pylori urease I subunit (UreI20-29, UreI98-107) and four antigenic fragments of H. pylori urease B subunit (UreB12-23, UreB229-251, UreB327-400, UreB515-561), resulting in the recombinant CTB-UreI-UreB (BIB). Its protective effect against H. pylori infection was evaluated in BALB/c mice. Significant protection against H. pylori challenge was achieved in BALB/c mice immunized with BIB (15/18, 83.3\%), rIB plus rCTB (6/18, 33.3\%) and rIB (2/18, 11.1\%) separately, while no protective effect was found in the mice immunized with either adjuvant rCTB alone or PBS. The induction of significant protection against H. pylori is possibly mediated by specific serum IgA and mucosal sIgA antibodies, and a mixed Th1/Th2/Th17 cells response. This multi-epitope vaccine might be a promising vaccine candidate that helps to control H. pylori infection.},

The discovery of Helicobacter pylori, a carcinogenic bacterial pathogen that infects the stomach mucosa of more than one half of all humans globally, has started a major paradigm shift in our understanding of the stomach as an ecological niche for bacteria. The special adaptations that enable H. pylori to colonize this well-protected habitat have been intensively studied over the last three decades. In contrast, our knowledge concerning bacteria other than H. pylori in the human stomach is still quite limited. However, a substantial body of evidence documents convincingly that bacteria can regularly be sampled from the stomachs of healthy adults. Commonly detected phyla include Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, and characteristic genera are Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Propionibacterium. In this review, we summarize the available literature about the gastric microbiota in humans and selected model animals, discuss the methods used in its characterization, and identify gaps in our knowledge that need to be addressed to advance our understanding of the bacterial colonization of the different layers of the gastric mucosa and its potential role in health and disease.},

  abstract = {AIM: Interleukin-23 (IL-23) and IL-23 receptor (IL23R) play an important role during the T-helper 17 (Th17) cell-mediated inflammatory process as well as pathogenesis of multiple cancers. Several IL-23R single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), especially rs6682925, rs10889677 and rs1884444 polymorphisms, are considered to have significant impacts on susceptibility of multiple cancers. A number of case-control studies have explored the role these genetic polymorphisms in development of carcinogenesis, but the conclusions are inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to systematically investigate the associations between the three genetic variants and multiple cancer risk. METHODS: A total of ten studies are eligible (12,211 patients and 14,650 controls). Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and the 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) were appropriately calculated using either fixed-effect model or random-effect model. RESULTS: Significant associations between rs6682925 or rs10889677 polymorphism and cancer risk were found (OR=1.11, 95\% CI=1.03-1.21, P=0.007; or OR=0.85, 95\% CI=0.71-0.92, P=0.001). However, there was no such association between rs1884444 genotypes and cancer susceptibility (P{$>$}0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings reveal that the IL-23R rs6682925 and rs10889677 genetic variants play a more important part in pathogenesis of multiple cancers.},

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of  H .  pylori  eradication on the human gut microbiome.       Methods   As part of the currently on-going ESSAY (Eradication Study in Stable Adults/Youths) study, we collected stool samples from 17  H .  pylori -positive young adult (18\textendash 30 years-old) volunteers. The same cohort was followed up 6, 12 and 18 months-post  H .  pylori  eradication. The impact of  H .  pylori  on the human gut microbiome pre- and post-eradication was investigated using high throughput 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 region) sequencing using the Illumina Miseq followed by data analysis using Qiime pipeline.       Results   We compared the composition and diversity of bacterial communities in the fecal microbiome of the  H .  pylori -positive volunteers, before and after  H .  pyl ori eradication therapy. The 16S rRNA gene was sequenced at an average of 150,000\textendash 170,000 reads/sample. The microbial diversity were similar pre- and post- H .  pylori  eradication with no significant differences in richness and evenness of bacterial species. Despite that the general profile of the gut microbiome was similar pre- and post-eradication, some changes in the bacterial communities at the phylum and genus levels were notable, particularly the decrease in relative abundance of  Bacterioidetes  and corresponding increase in  Firmicutes  after  H .  pylori  eradication. The significant increase of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing bacteria genera could also be associated with increased risk of metabolic disorders.       Conclusions   Our preliminary stool metagenomics study shows that eradication of  H .  pylori  caused perturbation of the gut microbiome and may indirectly affect the health of human. Clinicians should be aware of the effect of broad spectrum antibiotics used in  H .  pylori  eradication regimen and be cautious in the clinical management of  H .  pylori  infection, particularly in immunocompromised patients.},

They are the cornerstones of synthetic biology, and are potential candidate targets for antimicrobial and vaccine design.Description: Here we describe the Cluster of Essential Genes (CEG) database, which contains clusters of orthologous essential genes. Based on the size of a cluster, users can easily decide whether an essential gene is conserved in multiple bacterial species or is species-specific. It contains the similarity value of every essential gene cluster against human proteins or genes. The CEG\_Match tool is based on the CEG database, and was developed for prediction of essential genes according to function. The database is available at http://cefg.uestc.edu.cn/ceg. CONCLUSIONS: Properties contained in the CEG database, such as cluster size, and the similarity of essential gene clusters against human proteins or genes, are very important for evolutionary research and drug design. An advantage of CEG is that it clusters essential genes based on function, and therefore decreases false positive results when predicting essential genes in comparison with using the similarity alignment method.},

In early clinical trials as well as in animal models, IL-12 has been implicated as a major mediator of these diseases based on the ability of anti-p40 mAb treatment to reverse intestinal inflammation. The cytokine IL-23 shares the same p40 subunit with IL-12, and the anti-p40 mAbs used in human and mouse IBD studies neutralized the activities of both IL-12 and IL-23. IL-10-deficient mice spontaneously develop enterocolitis. To determine how IL-23 contributes to intestinal inflammation, we studied the disease susceptibility in the absence of either IL-23 or IL-12 in this model, as well as the ability of recombinant IL-23 to exacerbate IBD induced by T cell transfer. Our study shows that in these models, IL-23 is essential for manifestation of chronic intestinal inflammation, whereas IL-12 is not. A critical target of IL-23 is a unique subset of tissue-homing memory T cells, which are specifically activated by IL-23 to produce the proinflammatory mediators IL-17 and IL-6. This pathway may be responsible for chronic intestinal inflammation as well as other chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases.},

Activation of PAR has a pro-inflammatory effect through the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. PAR(2) activation in human esophageal epithelial cells by trypsin induces NFkappaB- and AP-1-dependent IL-8 production in association with activation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2, suggesting that esophageal inflammation may be induced by PAR(2) activation via reflux of trypsin. It has been also proposed that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) induces PAR expression in the gastric epithelial cells and H. pylori-derived serine proteinase promotes IL-8 production via PAR in the epithelial cells. In addition, an increase of PAR-dependent IL-8 production has been observed in H. pylori-infected human gastric mucosa, suggesting an important role for PAR(2) in the modulation of gastric inflammation associated with H. pylori. Recent studies have strongly indicated that tryptase and PAR are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and experimental colitis. We demonstrated that anti-tryptase therapy may become a new therapeutic strategy in human ulcerative colitis. Thus, the role of PAR in the gastrointestinal tract has been gradually clarified, but further investigations are needed because the receptor has a variety of functions.},

We here show a role for IL-27 in the induction of T-bet expression and regulation of Ig class switching in B cells. Expression of WSX-1, one subunit of IL-27R, was detected at the mRNA level in primary mouse spleen B cells, and stimulation of these B cells by IL-27 rapidly activated STAT1. IL-27 then induced T-bet expression and IgG2a, but not IgG1, class switching in B cells activated with anti-CD40 or LPS. In contrast, IL-27 inhibited IgG1 class switching induced by IL-4 in activated B cells. Similar induction of STAT1 activation, T-bet expression and IgG2a class switching was observed in IFN-gamma-deficient B cells, but not in STAT1-deficient ones. The induction of IgG2a class switching was abolished in T-bet-deficient B cells activated with LPS. These results suggest that primary spleen B cells express functional IL-27R and that the stimulation of these B cells by IL-27 induces T-bet expression and IgG2a, but not IgG1, class switching in a STAT1-dependent but IFN-gamma-independent manner. The IL-27-induced IgG2a class switching is highly dependent on T-bet in response to T-independent stimuli such as LPS. Thus, IL-27 may be a novel attractive candidate as a therapeutic agent against diseases such as allergic disorders by not only regulating Th1 differentiation but also directly acting on B cells and inducing IgG2a class switching.},

We have purified another proinflammatory protein that is chemotactic for human neutrophils from conditioned medium of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes. After a series of steps that included anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and HPLC on cation-exchange and reverse-phase columns, an apparently pure protein was obtained that migrated as a single 7-kDa band on NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels under reducing or nonreducing conditions. The amino acid composition of this monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor was different from that of interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor. N-terminal amino acid sequence of the first 42 residues was determined. This portion of the molecule has up to 56\% sequence similarity with several proteins that may be involved in host responses to infection or tissue injury. It is identical to a portion of a sequence deduced from an mRNA induced by staphylococcal enterotoxin treatment of human leukocytes. At the optimal concentration of 10 nM, 50\% of neutrophils added to chemotaxis assay wells migrated toward the pure attractant. Potency and efficacy are comparable to that of fMet-Leu-Phe, which is often used as a reference. In contrast to many attractants, the protein was not chemotactic for human monocytes.},

Although the IL-27-mediated Th1 initiation mechanism has been elucidated, little is known about the molecular basis for the suppression of cytokine production. In the present study, we demonstrated that IL-27 suppressed the production of various proinflammatory cytokines by fully activated CD4+ T cells while it had no effect on the cytokine production by CD4+ T cells at early phases of activation. IL-27 also suppressed IL-17 production by activated CD4+ T cells, thereby counteracting IL-23, another IL-12-related cytokine with proinflammatory effects. In fully activated CD4+ T cells, STAT3 was preferentially activated by IL-27 stimulation, whereas both STAT1 and 3 were activated by IL-27 in early activated CD4+ T cells. Lack of STAT3 in fully activated cells impaired the suppressive effects of IL-27. These data indicated that the preferential activation of STAT3 in fully activated CD4+ T cells plays an important role in the cytokine suppression by IL-27/WSX-1.},

If one has collected N total samples and assayed the expression level of G genes on those samples, then an N x N similarity matrix can be formed that reflects the correlation or similarity of the samples with respect to the expression values over the G genes. This matrix can then be examined for patterns via standard data reduction and cluster analysis techniques. We consider an alternative to conventional data reduction and cluster analyses of similarity matrices that is rooted in traditional linear models. This analysis method allows predictor variables collected on the samples to be related to variation in the pairwise similarity/distance values reflected in the matrix. The proposed multivariate method avoids the need for reducing the dimensions of a similarity matrix, can be used to assess relationships between the genes used to construct the matrix and additional information collected on the samples under study, and can be used to analyze individual genes or groups of genes identified in different ways. The technique can be used with any high-dimensional assay or data type and is ideally suited for testing subsets of genes defined by their participation in a biochemical pathway or other a priori grouping. We showcase the methodology using three published gene expression data sets.},

Although there are examples where immune responses have been activated, there are few instances of achieving a reduced bacterial load. In vivo and in vitro analyses in both mice and humans demonstrates that the host responds to H. pylori infection through the activation of immunoregulatory mechanisms designed to suppress the anti-H. pylori response.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori is one of the most common gastric pathogens, affecting at least half the world's population, and is strongly associated with gastritis, peptic ulcer, gastric adenocarcinoma, and lymphoma. We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a three-dose oral recombinant H pylori vaccine in children in China. METHODS: We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at one centre in Ganyu County, Jiangsu Province, China. Healthy children aged 6-15 years without past or present H pylori infection were randomly assigned (1:1), via computer-generated randomisation codes in blocks of ten, to receive the H pylori vaccine or placebo. Participants, their guardians, and study investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was the occurrence of H pylori infection within 1 year after vaccination. We did analysis in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02302170. FINDINGS: Between Dec 2, 2004, and March 19, 2005, we randomly assigned 4464 participants to either the vaccine group (n=2232) or the placebo group (n=2232), of whom 4403 (99\%) participants completed the three-dose vaccination schedule and were included in the per-protocol efficacy analysis. We extended follow-up to 3 years. We recorded 64 events of H pylori infection within the first year (14 events in 2074{$\cdot$}3 person-years at risk in the vaccine group vs 50 events in 2089{$\cdot$}6 person-years at risk in the placebo group), resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 71{$\cdot$}8\% (95\% CI 48{$\cdot$}2-85{$\cdot$}6). 157 (7\%) participants in the vaccine group and 161 (7\%) participants in the placebo group reported at least one adverse reaction. Serious adverse events were reported in five ({$<$}1\%) participants in the vaccine group and seven ({$<$}1\%) participants in the placebo group, but none was considered to be vaccination related. INTERPRETATION: The oral recombinant H pylori vaccine was effective, safe, and immunogenic in H pylori-naive children. This vaccine could substantially reduce the incidence of H pylori infection; however, follow up over a longer period is needed to confirm the protection of the vaccine against H pylori-associated diseases.

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is playing an increasingly important role in cardiovascular research. Proteomics includes identification and quantification of proteins and the characterization of protein modifications, such as posttranslational modifications and sequence variants. The conventional bottom-up approach, involving proteolytic digestion of proteins into small peptides before MS analysis, is routinely used for protein identification and quantification with high throughput and automation. Nevertheless, it has limitations in the analysis of protein modifications, mainly because of the partial sequence coverage and loss of connections among modifications on disparate portions of a protein. An alternative approach, top-down MS, has emerged as a powerful tool for the analysis of protein modifications. The top-down approach analyzes whole proteins directly, providing a "bird's-eye" view of all existing modifications. Subsequently, each modified protein form can be isolated and fragmented in the mass spectrometer to locate the modification site. The incorporation of the nonergodic dissociation methods, such as electron-capture dissociation (ECD), greatly enhances the top-down capabilities. ECD is especially useful for mapping labile posttranslational modifications that are well preserved during the ECD fragmentation process. Top-down MS with ECD has been successfully applied to cardiovascular research, with the unique advantages in unraveling the molecular complexity, quantifying modified protein forms, complete mapping of modifications with full-sequence coverage, discovering unexpected modifications, identifying and quantifying positional isomers, and determining the order of multiple modifications. Nevertheless, top-down MS still needs to overcome some technical challenges to realize its full potential. Herein, we reviewed the advantages and challenges of the top-down method, with a focus on its application in cardiovascular research.},

The physical characteristic of these cells is consistent with their ability to traverse epithelial tight junctions as reported by Maria Recigno.3 Gastric CD103(+) dendritic cells, which are known to induce mucosal regulatory T cells, were also increased in number, raising the question whether H. pylori infection induces a regulatory T cell-skewed response by way of a bacteria-dendritic cell interaction. In fact, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells underwent tolerogenic programming, skewing the balance between effector and regulatory T cell responses towards regulatory T cell differentiation in a transforming growth factor-{$\beta$}- and interleukin-10-dependent manner. Depletion of regulatory T cell numbers augmented H. pylori-specific effector helper T cell responses, which correlated with a lower degree of H. pylori colonization. These results suggest H. pylori is capable of inducing a regulatory T cell-skewed response that limits the host's ability to eradicate the bacteria, allowing the H. pylori infection to persist. To better understand the mechanism of H. pylori tolerogenic programming we compared the differential expressions of 34 genes critical for dendritic cell function in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells pulsed with live H. pylori or other Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter lwoffii). Our data imply that H. pylori targets the Toll-like receptor 2 pathway to induce a regulatory T cell-skewed response. In addition, we show that H. pylori-pulsed dendritic cells are capable of inducing the conversion of na\"ive T cells to regulatory T cells. These observations are evidence of a unique tolerogenic program in dendritic cells that involves active editing of the immune response by H. pylori, favoring its persistence in the gastric mucosa.},

Emerging evidence indicates that H. pylori infection may also protect against asthma and some other immune-mediated conditions through regulatory T cell effects outside the stomach. To characterize the complexity of the CD4+ T cell response generated during H. pylori infection, computational methods were previously used to generate a panel of 90 predicted epitopes conserved among H. pylori genomes that broadly cover HLA Class II diversity for maximum population coverage. Here, these sequences were tested individually for their ability to induce in vitro responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by interferon-{$\gamma$} ELISpot assay. The average number of spot-forming cells/million PBMCs was significantly elevated in H. pylori-infected subjects over uninfected persons. Ten of the 90 peptides stimulated IFN-{$\gamma$} secretion in the H. pylori-infected group only, whereas two out of the 90 peptides elicited a detectable IFN-{$\gamma$} response in the H. pylori-uninfected subjects but no response in the H. pylori-infected group. Cytokine ELISA measurements performed using in vitro PBMC culture supernatants demonstrated significantly higher levels of TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TGF-{$\beta$}1 in the H. pylori-infected subjects, whereas IL-17A expression was not related to the subjects H. pylori-infection status. Our results indicate that the human T cell responses to these 90 peptides are generally increased in actively H. pylori-infected, compared with H. pylori-na\"ive, subjects. This information will improve understanding of the complex immune response to H. pylori, aiding rational epitope-driven vaccine design as well as helping identify other H. pylori epitopes with potentially immunoregulatory effects.},

METHOD Murine gastric epithelial cells, GSM06, were cultured with or without H. pylori (Sydney strain-1) at different osmolarities in the range of 300-450 mOsM. Expressions of IL-1beta mRNA and mature IL-1beta protein were evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and an IL-1beta enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. IL-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) activity was measured by an ICE colorimetric assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by a single stranded-DNA assay. RESULTS Addition of H. pylori at 300 mosM caused significant increases in IL-1beta mRNA, IL-1beta protein, ICE activity and apoptosis. Hyperosmotic stress alone also caused upregulation of IL-1beta mRNA and IL-1beta protein, enhanced ICE activity and accelerated apoptosis. Hyperosmotic stress accentuated the increases in IL-1beta mRNA, IL-1beta protein, ICE activity and apoptosis induced by H. pylori alone. Enhancement of IL-1beta protein release induced by hyperosmotic stress was significantly attenuated by an ICE inhibitor, Z-YVAD-FMK. CONCLUSIONS Hyperosmotic stress enhances the release of bioactive mature IL-1beta protein in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells, in part by upregulating IL-1beta mRNA expression, and in part by enhancing ICE activity. These results may explain the mechanisms by which chronic intake of a high salt diet increases the risk of gastric cancer among H. pylori-infected human subjects.},

Vaccine, especially edible vaccine, is considered to be effective in the management of H.~pylori infections. By using recombinant technology, Lactococcus lactis (L.~lactis) could serve as an antigen-delivering vehicle for the development of edible vaccine. The aim of this study was to produce edible UreB (urease B) vaccine derived from L.~lactis against H.~pylori. The UreB subunit is the most effective and common immunogen of all strains of H.~pylori. The UreB was produced as a chimeric protein fused with IL-2 (human interleukin 2) as the mucosal adjuvant. Mucosal immunization of mice with recombinant L.~lactis NZ9000 containing the UreB-IL-2 protein elicited more anti-UreB antibody that specifically bounded to the purified bacterial UreB protein and more cytokines such as IFN-{$\gamma$}, IL-4, and IL-17, and had a lower H.~pylori burden and urease activity than control mice. These results suggest that the recombinant L.~lactis expressing UreB-IL-2 can be potentially used as an edible vaccine for controlling H.~pylori infection.},

Since that time, progress in the development of a preventive or therapeutic H. pylori vaccine has been relatively slow. The impediments to rapid advances in the field include a luke-warm enthusiasm among clinicians, research scientists, and public health authorities concerning the need for a vaccine, rudimentary understanding of the correlates of gastric immunity to H. pylori and of gastric mucosal immunology in general, the geographical heterogeneity of the H. pylori genome and insufficient pharmaceutical industry support. Recent enhancements in our understanding of the gastric immune response together with advances in H. pylori genomics now provide the potential to accelerate progress in H. pylori vaccine development. Whether an H. pylori vaccine becomes a reality will likely depend upon our ability to appropriately target the populations at highest risk of the adverse sequelae of infection.},

The changes in glycoprotein abundance, glycosylation degree, and glycan structure are associated with a variety of diseases. Therefore, the quantitative study of glycoproteomics has become a new and popular research topic, and is quickly emerging as an important technique for biomarker discovery. Mass spectrometry-based protein quantification technologies provide a powerful tool for the systematic and quantitative assessment of the quantitative differences in the protein profiles of different samples. Combined with various glycoprotein/glycopeptide enrichment strategies and other glycoprotein analysis methods, these techniques have been further developed for application in quantitative glycoproteomics. A comprehensive quantitative analysis of the glycoproteome in a complex biological sample remains challenging because of the enormous complexity of biological samples, intrinsic characteristics of glycoproteins, and lack of universal quantitative technology. In this review, recently developed technologies in quantitative glycoproteome, especially those focused on two of the most common types of glycosylation (N-linked and O-linked glycoproteome), were summarized. The strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches were also discussed.},

These microorganisms include bacteria, virus, and fungi. Among them, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is by far the most important risk factor for GC development, with special reference to the early-onset cases. H. pylori targets multiple cellular components by utilizing various virulence factors to modulate the host proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and inflammatory response. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serves as another major risk factor in gastric carcinogenesis. The virus protein, EBER noncoding RNA, and EBV miRNAs contribute to the tumorigenesis by modulating host genome methylation and gene expression. In this review, we summarized the related reports about the colonized microorganism in the stomach and discussed their specific roles in gastric tumorigenesis. Meanwhile, we highlighted the therapeutic significance of eradicating the microorganisms in GC treatment.},

We demonstrate here that IL-6 induced expression of IL-21 that amplified an autocrine loop to induce more IL-21 and IL-23 receptor in naive CD4(+) T cells. Both IL-21 and IL-23, along with TGF-beta, induced IL-17 expression independently of IL-6. The effects of IL-6 and IL-21 depended on STAT3, a transcription factor required for the differentiation of T(H)-17 cells in vivo. IL-21 and IL-23 induced the orphan nuclear receptor RORgammat, which in synergy with STAT3 promoted IL-17 expression. IL-6 therefore orchestrates a series of 'downstream' cytokine-dependent signaling pathways that, in concert with TGF-beta, amplify RORgammat-dependent differentiation of T(H)-17 cells.},

We investigated their role in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. METHODS: We used flow cytometry analyses to determine levels and phenotype of Tc17 cells in blood and tumor samples from 103 patients with gastric cancer. We performed multivariate analysis to identify factors associated with overall survival using the Cox proportional hazards model. CD8(+) T cells and monocytes were isolated and cocultured in an assay for induction of Tc17 cells. Tumor cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were isolated and used in assays of Tc17 cell function. RESULTS: Tc17 cells with distinct cytokine and functional profiles were found in gastric tumor samples from patients. The percentage of Tc17 cells increased with tumor progression and was associated with overall survival time. Tumor-activated monocytes secreted IL-6, IL-1{$\beta$}, and IL-23, which promoted development of Tc17 cell populations. Supernatants from cultured Tc17 cells induced production of the chemokine CXCL12 by tumor cells; this promoted CXCR4-dependent migration of MDSCs and impaired functions of anti-tumor CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells via a cell contact-dependent mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: Percentages of Tc17 cells in gastric tumors are associated with survival times of patients. These cells promote chemotaxis of MDSCs, which might promote tumor progression.},

Subsets of the same lineage may express different effector cytokines, reside at different locations or give rise to cells with different fates, whereas cells from different lineages may secrete common cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-9 and IL-10, resulting in massive heterogeneity of the Th cell population. In addition, the pattern of cytokine secretion may switch from that of one lineage toward another under certain circumstances, suggesting that Th cells are plastic. Tregs are also more heterogeneous and plastic than were originally thought. In this review, we summarize recent reports on heterogeneity and plasticity of Th cells, and discuss potential mechanisms and implications of such features that Th cells display.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: IL-17 plays an important role in autoimmunity, promoting autoimmunity, inflammation and invasion in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and type I diabetes. The role of IL-17 in cancer is unclear, however, as there are few studies examining IL-17 protein expression in cancer. We therefore examined IL-17 protein expression in human breast cancer and modelled its potential biological significance in vitro. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to determine IL-17 expression in breast cancers. Matrigel invasion assays were employed to examine the effect of IL-17 on cancer cell invasion by a panel of breast cancer cell lines. The role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was investigated with selective antagonists and immunoassays for MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of MMP. RESULTS: IL-17-expressing cells with macrophage morphology were identified in the peritumoural area of a proportion of patients (8/19 patients). Macrophages were confirmed by CD68 staining on serial sections. With the exception of occasional lymphocytes, one patient with rare multinucleate giant cells and one patient with occasional expression of IL-17 in tumour cells, no other IL-17-positive cells were detected. Addition of IL-17 to cell lines in vitro stimulated marked invasion of Matrigel. In contrast, IL-17 did not promote the invasion of MCF7 or T47D cell lines. Invasion was initially thought to be dependent on MMPs, as evidenced by the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001 and selective antagonists of MMP-2/MMP-9 and MMP-3. Measurement of MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-9, and tissue inhibitor of MMP 1 secretion, failed to reveal any changes in expression following IL-17 exposure. In contrast, TNF promoted secretion of MMPs but IL-17 did not augment TNF, indicating that IL-17 acts via an independent mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first to describe in situ expression of IL-17 protein in human breast tumours and to propose a direct association between IL-17 and breast cancer invasion. The precise effectors of IL-17-dependent invasion remain to be characterised but could include a range of proteases such as a disintegrin and metalloproteinase protein or astacins. Nevertheless, this work identifies a novel potential mechanism for breast cancer invasion and tumour progression, the prognostic implication of which is currently under investigation.},

  abstract = {T cells surviving the clonal selection process emigrate from the thymus to the periphery as immature naive T cells. In the periphery, upon activation under specific cytokine milieus, naive T cells adopt specific effector phenotypes, e.g. T-helper 1 (Th1), Th2, or Th17, and acquire diverse functions to control a myriad of pathogens, tissue injuries, and other immunological insults. Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is one of the key cytokines that shapes the development and function of Th17 cells with characteristic expression of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor {$\gamma$}-t (ROR{$\gamma$}t), IL-17, IL-22, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). More recently, emerging data suggest that IL-23 also promotes development of 'natural Th17' (nTh17) cells that arise from the thymus, analogous to natural regulatory T cells (nTreg). We are just beginning to understand the unique thymic developmental path of nTh17 cells, which are distinct from antigen-experienced memory Th17 cells. In this review, we explore the differentiation and function of inducible, natural, and memory Th17 subsets, which encompass a broad range of immune functions while maintaining tissue hemostasis, and highlight the participation of IL-23 during the life cycle of Th17 cells.},

  abstract = {Hospital information systems are state of the art nowadays. Therefore, Digital Pathology, also labelled as Virtual Microscopy, has gained increased attention. Triggered by radiology, standardized information models and workflows were world-wide defined based on DICOM. However, DICOM-conform integration of Digital Pathology into existing clinical information systems imposes new problems requiring specific solutions concerning the huge amount of data as well as the special structure of the data to be managed, transferred, and stored. We implemented a testbed to realize and evaluate the workflow of digitized slides from acquisition to archiving. The experiences led to the draft of a DICOM-conform information model that accounted for extensions, definitions, and technical requirements necessary to integrate digital pathology in a hospital-wide DICOM environment. Slides were digitized, compressed, and could be viewed remotely. Real-time transfer of the huge amount of data was optimized using streaming techniques. Compared to a recent discussion in the DICOM Working Group for Digital Pathology (WG26) our experiences led to a preference of a JPEG2000/JPIP-based streaming of the whole slide image. The results showed that digital pathology is feasible but strong efforts by users and vendors are still necessary to integrate Digital Pathology into existing information systems.},
